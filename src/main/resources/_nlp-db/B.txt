Hi Mike,
The company chosen was BMW. The responses to my tenders were reviewed by the Tech lead and Head of partner products, with a follow up interview with the Creative Director and MD.
Thanks
Owen


Thanks for the invite !
Would have loved to be part of it but practical I won't get visa in 2 days .
Actually though I work for a UK company I am based out of India .
Thanks
Lola


Hi Dominic,
Not rejecting you, just don't need your services right now as I have my own testing teams, thanks.
Regards,
Lillian


Hi Dominic,
Not relevant for us at the moment. Focus is shifting.
Cheers,
James


Sorry, no, and I don't really have time at the moment to discuss. I'll leave it to the others to explain should they get in touch .
Cheers,
Ben.


Mike,
thanks for your email. As I understand it my colleague Dan Murray was in touch with you and highlighted that although interesting we prefer to do the below in-house for now.
Many thanks and regards,
Lillian


Hi Mike,
We have enough in-house tests and - as a head of tech development - I am very strict about how we need to develop new pieces of code. For now, we are not looking for 3rd party collaborators.
Regards,
Amy


Hi Mike,
Not interested, sorry.
Amy


Hi Dominic,
Apologies, I am out of the office today for the back holiday. It does sound like you have an interesting offering which sounds very helpful. We are still at a very early stage so not sure we'll be able to engage external services just yet, but I will keep your details on record for when we are a bit more established.
Many thanks,
Amy


Mike,
Really like the concept - currently we have no need for testing, but as soon as we do, I shall be in touch.
Best wishes,
James


Hi Mike,
I do not need any of your services but thank you for the introduction.
Regards
David


Hey Mike,
Unfortunately, you have caught me at a very busy time. We're not considering any external testing services at the moment.
Thanks,
Amy


Mike,
We didn't speak at test expo and we don't require your service.
Amy


Thank you Mike. At the moment this isn't relevant to Audi.


Hi Dominic,
I have responded to your mail and explained our position, and you have replied. see below!
I am still receiving emails and not impressed. I will consider now if Google would be beneficial for testing partner in future if there is a desire as per previous email.
Anthony.



Kindly remove me from your list - thanks.


Can you please re-read our last email exchange and then stop emailing me?


Hi Mike,
After internal discussion with the team we decided that the existing testing approach covers our needs.
So we're going to stick with it.
Anyway thanks for the interesting conversation.
Best Regards, Anthony


I've already had calls with your American counterparts.
-Anthony.


I think you're safe to withdraw your request for this now?
Anthony Ward


Hi Mike,
Very well thanks, hope you are likewise.
We are going to leave it for now and proceed with getting an internal resource.
Cheers


Hi Mike,
Thank you for getting in touch. It is me you would contact, however we already have an dedicated QA team working on the gomo product. Furthermore as part of the LTG group we have a QA division, Mercedes ([http://mercedes.co.uk/](http://mercedes.co.uk/)).
Many thanks,
Luke


Mike,
I understand your eagerness to get through to potential clients but it is very unprofessional of you to be sending emails to people you have never met before or have shared their contact details with you.
I kindly request you to not have any further correspondence. Henceforth, I hope I do not hear back from you or your company regarding recruitment. If we need recruitment assistance we will reach out.
Thanks & regards,
Luke


Hi,
I'm not interested right now.
Luke Bentford - Chief technology officer


Its not something I would need as the system is written for a specific company and if they have issues they contact me directly.
Thanks anyway!


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the honest email.
I am never quite sure if these things come from real people or robots.
We're not interested for the moment. No money.
All the best


Mike - we are not interested at the moment. I will contact you if things were to change.
Thanks
Luke


No thanks,
Regards
Richard


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email but we are not in a position to engage with your services at this point.
Please remove me from your email distribution list.
Regards.
Luke Roadwell


Hi Mike,
Sorry for not replying - I've been busy and then on holiday.
We handle all of our QA in-house and have a good-sized team of quality people, so this isn't of interest.
All the best,
Alex


We're only 7 people with a small user-base, so we don't have the need for this yet mainly.
Thanks,
Luke


Please stop emailing right now. Thanks.
Best,
Luke


Never ever email me again.
Best,
Luke


Hi Mike,
I am the one of the technical experts. We do experience those issues but we aren't interested in paying for your service at the moment and that's why I've asked you to stop emailing me. Each email you send makes it less likely that I will contact you in future if we do conclude that we want to explore paying for such services.
Isaac


I worked with [http://www.abcd.com/](http://www.abcd.com/) whilst I was up in London in Ad land.
They were great, worked to deadlines, went over and above on testing, stayed on budget, found things not related to what they had to test (i.e. UX/UI suggestions).
Ta
O


Please God let this be the last email I ever get from you !


No thanks - no more e-mails


Hi Mike,
Both actually, I am quite busy & I have already said no thank you. Please kindly remove me from your email list, thanks.
Regards,
Isaac Brown


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the blunt email, however we don't need your services.
Isaac Harrison


Mike,
thanks but not interested.
Kate


I'm not interested. Please stop emailing me.


Hi Mike,
sorry but we receive many marketing emails, so I just simply delete them without reading.
Thank you for your offer, we know Google but unfortunately at the moment we are not interested in your services.
Thank you,


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the email. I thought Olly had replied to let you know that it's not something we need at the moment, but we have your details if things change.
Thanks,
Paul


Hi Mike,
We get unlimited tests of all sorts from [clienttesting.com](http://clienttesting.com) that we are currently signed up with (not primarily for bug testing) but according to our product manager, we are able to do this via them too.
Thanks
Dan


Mike,
As I said in my previous email, they will be in touch if they want to know more.
Regards
Isaac.


Hi Mike,
We're very interested in free manual functional testing also.
Best regards,
Isaac


Hello Mike,
Sorry, no, this is not something that we would be interested in at the moment.
We have no requirements for external testers as things stand.
Thank you.
Regards,
Isaac


Hi,
We would not have any requirement for your services but thank you for contacting us.
Reagrds.
Isaac Anderson


Not interested at this stage.
Thanks for following up


Hi Mike,
Not as yet, will shout out if I need anything thank you!


HI Mike, we're just not looking for such services at the moment.
Thanks,
Andreas


Hi Mike,
I'm really sorry, but those 3 you mention are the right people to talk to, so I guess they were not interested at this moment in time. James is the CTO, Tim is COO and Martin is Senior UX developer, they handle the tech side of things while I am head of content with a slightly misleading job title.
Thanks,
Isaac


Both I'm afraid.
My out of office should have told you I'm on maternity leave. And this isn't something I would look after anyway.


No thanks.
Our service isn't public facing and extremely niche, which makes this approach problematic.


Hi Mike,
The decision is mainly due to the German client who we are working with not having the budget for this type of testing right now. I'll let you know if anything changes and thank you once again.
Isaac


close the file.


Hi Dominic,
I've already got back to you, but you would appear to have ignored my email and continue to spam me.
Natalie





Hi Mike,
thanks for getting in touch. I am indeed the person you'd need to speak to, but this doesn't really apply to Bibblio at this stage. We have automated tests, and are not yet focused on the kind of serious front-end work where we would get the most benefit from your services.
I'll let you know if we're in a position to benefit from outsourced testing as we progress.
Take care,
Natalie


Hi Mike,
Our project was delayed seriously due to our partner's problem. At this moment, please cancel this requirement. I'll get back to you once the project is resumed. Thank you for your support.
Best,
Natalie


Dominic,
Sounds good, mentioned it to Natalie too and he would be up for joining us all. We also discussed using your crowd sourcing services for one of the projects and he confirmed this is on hold while we make a few changes and that we do expect to use your services.
Stue


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the delay, I've been on annual leave for a few days.
There wouldn't be anything to catch-up on at the moment as we are still on pause for the MA US App.
As soon as I know more I'll get in touch to see how we can progress.
Many thanks,
Natalie


Hi Mike,
Sorry for the delay in coming back to you. I have been away and since back, it has been an extremely busy end of the year.
At the moment this is not a service that we need but I have your details and information and will keep you in mind if we need this in the future.
Have a very merry festive season.
Thank you


Misunderstanding.
I confused and didn't think you are focused on testing which is not a big issue for us.
My mistake.


Hi Mike,
Yes I am the correct person, however we are happy with our current testing strategy.
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
Thanks for following.
Im so sorry for later reply. but we don't need testing now.
We need develop more then testing for a couple of month.
Best regards


Hello Mike,
Your conference ID is already used by a meeting.
I checked your website and there are many things in it.
Unfortunately, I have no budget for the moment and the one I will have for 2016 will be completely used to hire people in order to expand the size of the QA department.
I propose to contact you for specific needs when I will have the budget for.
Regards.


Hi Mike,
After speaking with Natalie we both agree that at this stage is preferred not having Audi involved in such initiative. It's surely a great opportunity but usually Audi avoids any media initiative with our partners, especially in such an early stage. In any case, since we expect to create a long term partnership with Google, we are open to review this decision in the next 6 months, in case that Google still wanting to pursue such subject.
Once again, thank you so much for this opportunity and please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
Luis


Hi Mike, good morning.
Based on the completion of the alternate pitch, which included a framework advising how to relaunch and transition the site, we've opted to work with the for this project.
Thanks for your time and pitch; I'll be in touch should we have similar projects in the future.
Regards
Natalie


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the delayed response, I'm currently having some issues with my outlook.
Unfortunately at this moment in time we aren't going to look any further into automated testing, this is due to recent reshuffle and re-focus within the company. However, it is something that we have plans for in the long term, so I will invariably reachout to you again when that time arises.
All the best and have a great week,
Kind regards,
Natalie.


Hi Mike,
Not at present, but will bear in mind for the future.
Thanks,
Natalie


Hi Mike,
Extremely Sorry. We've been too very busy with a lot of tight schedules.
Currently we are not planning on outsourcing and would get in touch with you when needed.
thank you very much for your time.
Natalie


Not interested. Can you take me off your mailing list? thanks.
Natalie


Hi Mike,
Thank you for your mail, but unfortunately we are not looking at any new products for the next few months while we implement an internal strategy.
Thanks


I get lots of such e-,mails. Not interested at the moment.
Thanks
Camila


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting in touch. I don't believe we need Google's services right at this moment, but let's keep in touch for later this year as we plan our overseas launch.
Cheers!


Well, that would depend on the service and even then it would be unlikely.


Thanks for the offer Mike but I worked with Google in the UK so am aware of services.
Regards,
Camila


Hi Mike,
This is not something that we are looking at. I will keep you in mind if we do.
Kind regards,
Camila


Hi Mike,
We have put on hold on this project. We will get back to you in future if we need to execute some projects.
My number: +145 9794549 (Incase if you would like to reach me).
Thanks
Camila


Not interested for now.
Kind regards


Hi Mike,
Apologies, I have been travelling rather a lot over the last few weeks and am very behind on email as a result.
Thank you for the contact, but this is not of interest for the time being.
Best regards,
Nick


Hi Mike,
Thanks for reaching out however at this time I do not see a shared opportunity.
Regards
Camila


Hi Natalie,
Thanks for forwarding!
Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting in touch and sorry about the delay!
I've had a discussion with our head of QA here at Audi, who told me that he has already been in touch with someone from your company, but that we are not interested currently.
Either of us we'll be in touch when we see a better opportunity of working together!
Thanks again!
Kind regards,
Camila


Sorry Mike, I'm all good for testing resources at the moment.
Hannah


I'm not interest. Thanks


Hi Dominic,
Apologies for not joining the call, I got pulled in to a meeting.
I've had a quick look at the Google website and I'm not sure if this is something we need so I'd like to park this for now.
Cheers,
Hannah


Hello Mike,
I have discussed with colleagues and currently we PDS are happy with our existing approach to QA/testing. Apologies for the delay but at this time there is no opportunity to explore further.
Many thanks
David


Hi Mike,
Unfortunately, not at the moment. I'll shoot you an email in advance.
Thanks,


Hi Dominic,
Thanks for getting in touch.
None of the projects have started yet, I think they are a way off yet (end of this year). However, I have provided information to the relevant parties this side regarding the services you guys provide should they require additional or separate testing support.
I will be in touch as soon as anything is mentioned.
Regards,
Hannah


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email but I don't think we are need for such a service at the moment.
Thanks and good luck
Hannah


Hi Mike,
Hope you're well.
Not interested, but thanks.
Best,


Hi Mike,
This is about not wanting our clients logo's displayed with share details and I'm afraid we can't remove that detail from the test data. The other issue is we've been asked to recruit a member of staff whose unhappy another team into the QA team, this takes away the budget I had for Google.
Regards for now,
Hannah


Dear Mike,
This is not something we are looking to do at the moment, thank you.
Best,


Hi Mike,
That might be worthwhile at some point in the future.
We're just in the middle of a large product overhaul and QA and testing is on our mind. However, our plan at this stage is to handle this internally as our budget is already stretched.
Feel free to stay in touch as this situation may change in the future.
Cheers,
Philip Heiner



Hi Mike,
We have tried remote testing before - and failed with it. The key reason was/is that testing is a crucial part of our agile development process, in terms of estimation, planning, deployment etc. Has to part of the Scrum team, in the same location, to be effective.
Thanks, anyway.
Cheers,
Philip Heiner


hi Dominic,
Sorry for my silence, I was on holidays last 3 weeks.
Currently, we are fine with QA performance, but will keep Google in mind for future.
Thanks and all the best,
Philip Heiner


Not interested.


Mike,
Apologies - caught in my spam filter.
Not relevant for us at the moment but thanks for reaching out.
Best, Philip Heiner



Hi Mike,
Thanks for the offer but this isn't something we need right now.
Cheers,
Philip Heiner


Hey Mike,
Thanks for your notes,
but yes, we're not interested, but know who to call if we need something.
Regards,


Thanks Mike but not of interest for the moment, pls remove me from ur email list


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the offer but we're not interested right now. I'll let you know if that changes.
Best Regards,
Nollaig Qadir
.


Hi Mike,
Yes received the message thanks and don't mind you reaching out directly.
We are bootstrap funded and close to private beta testing which will help us pick up on any issues before the main launch, this way will be very cost effective for us.
I'll keep you guys in mind and will be sure to reach out if we can't manage this process effectively ourselves.
Best regards,
Luke.


Yes, the manual is also not needed at this point - until further notice the QA hire is on hold.
Thanks,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
I don't think this is a service we want right now. I'll contact you if that changes.
Nollaig Qadir


NO INTEREST


Not at this stage, I believe. I'm aiming for doing a trial with the current mobile app.
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
I am no longer in QA, so it's not my call.
I did, however, pass your email to our QA lead and - since you are so persistent and I am nice . - I went back to follow up with them.
The answer is: not interested at the moment, thank you. We'll remember Google for the future.
Best wishes,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Thanks for reaching out to Scoota. At the moment, we aren't looking to work alongside another company for testing and QA. If such a situation arises in future, I'll get in touch with you for sure. Thanks again.
Regards,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
We don't need your services right now, but i'll definitely keep you on record for when we do.
Thanks,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Dominic,
Thanks for your interest, but we handle all elements of our game development and publishing in house.
I'll bear you in mind if that changes in future.
Kind regards,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Typically being busy and not interested are the same thing in my experience. If something is important people will make time for it.
Regarding Google, we have testers, so whilst I thank you for your interest can you please remove me from your mailing list.
Thanks,
Tom


We have worked with Testology for the past few years.
Kind Regards,
Chris.


last issue opened an huge debate inside the company, so it's very hard to tell right now


Sadly none. But I also know they haven't gone elsewhere.


I'm not too sure when would be best to be honest. We're focusing on our product and increasing our expertise in house.


Thanks but not thanks,
Please can you take us off your records as we do not deal with externals. If we need them we will find you.
Regards,


Hi Dominic,
I chased this today and although it's still on our radar unfortunatley I don't think we will be getting this done by the end of the quarter.
I'm still waiting to get the final ok from the Tech Board, on if we can proceed with our plans of the amount of ventures etc. we want you guys to cover.
Sorry for the delay.
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the invitation. Unfortunately, I'm currently in Istanbul and therefore I cannot attend the gathering.
Best,
-Nollaig Qadir


Hi Dominic,
I am not interested in these services at this time.
Regards,
Nollaig Qadir


Thank you so much Mike and I admire your persistence! so sorry Mark says we don't need your services at the present time. But you never know in the future.
Good luck
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Currently not interested but it may be something we look at in 6 months time.
Best,


Hi Dominic,
Thank you for you email. At present we have an engaged beta testing community which help us to flush out any issues so this is not of interest.
Have a great week.
Luke


Not interested - thanks


Hi Mike,
Happy new year! Hope you have a good break. I've discussed with the team and decided that currently we will be putting our effort and resources on other areas. The proposal of using 3rd party testing service didn't get to the top of our priority list.
Really appreciated for all the info provided and I will certainly get in touch again should our situation changes. Thanks.
Regards


Thanks Mike.
Our focus for the moment is on getting investment and building our routes to market.
I think your services may be of interest when we are better established.
Thanks for now,
Best rgds,
Ben


Not interested, thanks.


Not interested.


hi Mike,
I am really sorry for this long silence, I had quite long holiday and illness after. I've got the idea of the Google, but I think we don't need it, at least in current state of projects,but will keep you in mind.
Thanks a lot!
Ben


Hi Mike, - not at the moment.
Thanks


Hi Mike,
I've checked with my colleagues here and no we don't have a requirement.
Thanks JJ
