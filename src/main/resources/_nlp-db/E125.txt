Hi,
It will be in a little while (we are thinking of developing an app) but not currently - I am just brushing up on my knowledge.
Will contact you again when I believe a call may help - for now it's too early.
Thanks and regards
Mike


Hi Gale,
Apologies for the delayed response. Unfortunately the customer is still grappling with budgets as we are caught in the handover from one budget period to the next end June. Long story short it's a case of hurry up and wait - no decision expected now until next month. This may change when they realise impact on the development roadmap but I think we're going to just have to suck it up.
Not the answer I wanted but it is what it is.
Have a great weekend and I'll keep you posted.
John


Hi Bill,
Yes \- just keeping options open.
Speak soon, Ben.


Yes.
Our current spend on testing is Â£0!
After the next round of funding (due to close in the Nov - Feb window) it would make sense of us to invest in testing.
A fixed monthly spend in the low hundreds could easily be added to our budget.
Carl


Hi Mike -
Great talking to you. I'll revert to you once we are getting closer to releasing our new App.
Best,


Dear Anna,
It was pleasure meeting you last week, I do remember you and your coffee machine and the Italian man too.
I will contact you during next week after my meeting with the board of iTec.
Best regards,
Alexander


Hi Bill,
Happy new year and hope you've had some time off as well.
I'm really sorry that I've been so tardy, and I'm travelling on short notice at the moment for the next few days and on/off.
Could I perhaps simply get back in touch as soon as I'm back and I can make some time that I don't push around short notice ?
Kind regards,


Hi John,
Thanks for your email, just to let you know the signed NDA you returned did not have an extension and when trying to open the document I was unable to open the file.
I will check with our COO just to double check that these amendments are OK and will let you know.
Thanks again.
Kind Regards
Amy


Hi David,
I'm not interested I'm afraid - at least not right now.
Ben


Hi Mike,
this is exactly what I needed to know for now.
Thank you for your effort.
Best regards,
Bill


Hi Carl,
I hope you are well.
We will be holding off on this work for now. We are going to be running as few internal sessions with some members in coming weeks and will be deciding on next steps after this.
Thanks,
Dave


I would suggest that we get back to this in November, when there is more information about what we might need. Also a bit of rush now with product development so I don't have much time to concentrate on other things.
- Alexander


It's probably premature. I will keep this on the agenda and you are welcome to follow up from time to time.
Thanks,
Amy


Hi Anna,
I'm having a few conversations internally about this at the moment, I'll come back to you next week with an update.
Thanks,
Carl


Hi Dave,
Sorry I had not come back to you.
We are in the middle of a restructuring process and we have not decided yet on next steps.
We will be in touch with you as soon as things settle internally.
Best regards,
Gale


Hello Bill,
Thank you for your emails. Apologies I haven't come back to you sooner.
At this moment in time this is not something we are looking to commit to. However, we would be more than happy for you to keep in touch and possibly contact us again in the future regarding opportunities to work together.
Our business is still growing and much of our capabilities are currently handled in-house. We have plans to enter into new application areas and hopefully with this may then be more inclined to work with a company such as Kia for software testing.
Kind regards,


Hi John,
Unfortunately I don't have much time during the several next weeks.
I propose to contact you as soon as I can.
Regards.
Ben


Hi Mike,
Indeed I do remember BMW. We had an interesting chat. The coming weeks are very busy as our launch date is getting closer. I will be in-touch in due-course.
Regards
Anna


John,
I won't be available our call tomorrow sadly. Also, we have pivoted our development somewhat, and as such we won't need any help with crowdtesting over the next several months. It's probably worth getting back in touch with us this summer to start the conversation then.
Thanks,
Carl


Thanks Gale.
Unfortunately the outcome of the board meeting was to keep a tight control of costs for now, but I'll be back in touch as soon as that changes.
Best,
Anna


Hi Mike,
Thanks for further info. It's not relevant for us at the moment but will keep your details on file.
Amy


Not this week sorry. Please keep mail communication.
John


Hi Bill,
please can you contact me at november?
At this time we have our project planner full and we would like to hear about you then.
Thanks,


Hi Guys-
I caught up with Alexander this morning. He provided a great reference. It was genuinely a pleasure to speak to him.
Let's catch up on a call in the new year and see how we get on. I have a proposal from another testing company in early Jan.
Have a great Christmas,
Amy


Hello,
Ours partners are very late to deliver in the countries we expected,
so I couldn't commit for this quarter with Skoda, I think next quarter would be more reasonable for Kia,
Best regards,


Gale,
The vendor selection process for the development work is taking a bit longer than expected. Your proposal is still under consideration for this initiative, as we work out overall project timing. We actually discussed your proposal last week.
Glad you're staying in touch.
Thanks for your patience.
Bill


Hi Carl,
I am the right person but we are not in the position to talk right now. When we are we will be touch to see what you can do.
Thanks,
John


Hi Amy,
Thanks for the fast reply. It's more or less clear. I think it will be better to get back to you the next time, when we'll plan a next testing phase. Is it ok if I contact you in future?
Thanks,


Hi Anna,
Thanks for getting in touch, I'm assessing the needs internally.
Can we touch base in the new year?
Alexander


Hi Mike,
Apologies but I was unable to do significant progress in validating your proposed scenarios. Need to postpone this one.
Ben


Hi Bill,
Our company is moving to London and I will be responsible for the PMO processes and transition for the PM's. I'm currently traveling in the US but will get back to you as soon as I am back in Israel.
Thank you
John


Yes, I am the right person, but it's not the right time for us. Check back early next year.


Gale, we have not had the chance to review in detail, so suggest you make a file note to make contact end July if you've not heard from us. Bill


We are building a new site it will be ready in Feb there is no point testing out old site.
Have Phun!
John


Hi Anna,
I have discussed with my CTO and we are going to hold for the moment but perhaps you could follow up with me in 4 months pls.
Best,
Gale


Give me a call W/C 18th April please Bill, as the next two weeks re hectic, thanks you.
Regards,
David.


Hello Ben,
We have finalized our contract with local mobile operator,
We will start in june 2016 with this mobile operator,
we will have the global strategy in March and then I will send the paperworks to BMW, to have a test in May,
Best regards,


good morning Carl,
sorry I missed your calls, my boss is sick so he wasn't in yesterday and today, I will speak with him only next year on the 6th


Hi Ben,
Yes - and looking forward to the next one already! We have a company day going to Twham to watch the game, should be great fun.
So - here is where we are. In parallel to looking at your services we have been interviewing for testers. The initial intent being to have some in-house, but also a wild / crowd service to give us better coverage and surge flexibility. We didn't have a clear idea of how long the in-house bit would take to, but we are on the verge of offering a role to a more senior person than we had initially planned. This chap would join us as Hd of QA and take responsibility for outward management of your sort of work. I am very hopeful that we will get him working for us in only a few weeks, and that we will adopt your services very soon thereafter. However, it is only fair to him, being so close to joining, to have input into the decision and adoption of outside resources and anyone we bring in to work for him.
So, we have your quote, it will be one of my early tasks to work with the QA Head, assuming he joins us to quickly progress it.
Sorry for this slight change in direction, it was an unexpected find in identifying this specific person and seeing quite such a good fit, for a role that I'm not sure we had quite identified until we met him.
Thanks for your patience, stay in contact and let's see if we get reinject some moment when he is on-boarded.
Regards,


Hello Mike,
we are lunching september 1st, so we will deal with any new feature next month after launch so October,
Best,


Hi Anna,
we are currently fundraising. New investment will probably define our hiring capacity. I can't give you much at the moment, since I believe that we will close round in November/December. But I'll create reminder to contact you as soon as we close round and take our investment.
Cheers,
Mike


Hi Amy,
we will be closing projects near November.
And at this month, we can add new features to our systems.
regards,
John


Hey Ben,
Been swamped here - we're probably about 6 months away from wanting to get some external help with our test process - could we loop back in then?
Cheers,
Gale


Hi Bill,
Yes, this is something we may interest us in the future as we come out of Beta (and therefore ramp up our cross-browser testing), but not right at the moment.
Thanks,
Anna


Hi Carl,
Happy to have a chat next week but not in a position to make any commitments yet.
Cheers,
Anna


Hi Amy,
Thank you for your e-mail.
I understand John has replied to you to discuss this in early Jan.
I would prefer to do this around the same time.
Look forward to catching up with you later.
Regards,
Anna.


Hi - I'm interested, but I've been on holiday for the last few weeks as per my out of office so I haven't had a chance to look into it yet.


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the proposal. We will have an internal review next week and get back to you.
Have a nice weekend,


Hi John,
Thanks so much for getting this back so quickly, and for the recommendation on pricing. I will go over this with my manager, and give you some feedback.
Regards,
Amy


Hi Bill,
I will talk to one of my colleagues about the service and pass your details on if it is something we are looking for.
Thanks,
Mike


Hey Anna,
I keep Skoda in mind, the planning shifted a little bit,
I will keep you posted, Skoda is on our roadmap,
Amy


Hi Ben,
I was just about to email you today, so thank you for pestering!
I have had a chance to chat with everyone before the holidays, however, things are moving a bit slower here and we will need a bit more time before making a decision.
Mostly, since the dev/tech team came in with some fresh ideas after the holidays, and I will need to take some time and think of the implications.
I will get back to you with a final reply next week, Tuesday.
Kind regards,
Anna


Hi Gale,
My time in London was good however the QA person who I was supposed to be catching up with was sick and I missed him. I'll be doing a call with him this week and will let you know if he's interested in a demo.
Thanks,
Ben


Hi,
Apologies for the slow reply. I'm in the London office this week and will be catching up with the 7digital QA team. I'll Let you know if we wish to proceed with an Audi trial after catching up with the team.
Thanks,
Mike


Hi David,
Thanks for this.
Kind Regards
Carl


Hi John!
The new game with sounds! That is where it's at!
I have not been ignoring you, I promise, though December is crazy! I have managed to get 2 of the January releases ready yesterday, before the holidays, and today I have a little crisis. It never ends.
I have proposed the Beta Management Trial to our CTO and he promised we will be discussing it more today. We also have our Christmas party today.
I will call you as soon as I have an update!
Kind regards,
Anna


Hi Bill, yes, all good. Apologies for not responding. It was well received here.
Our research manager has now been briefed and will be using your proposal as a start point to assess other potential suppliers. I will update you in due course.
Kind regards


Thanks Gale,
Was a little caught up with few other activities, would take this presentation to max and keep you posted.
Ben


Hi Dave,
Happy New Year to you!
We are currently considering our options for 2017 web testing and will get back in the next week or so.
Best wishes,
Ben


Hi Mike,
Thanks for contact. I will take a look and come back if we need anything what you can help us with.
Cheers!
Anna


Hi Alexander,
Thanks for getting back to us. Nice to e-meet you .
We assumed we had more time with the licence, but we noticed access was blocked on the 28th so that answered my own question.
I will have a chat with the team regarding renewal and get back to you.
Best regards,
Carl


Hi Amy,
Thanks for the information.
Please give me a week or so to get back to you.
This week we have received the painful news that we need to save 20k from our IT budget (due to the UK referendum and forecasted risk of the Â£ devaluing in 2017) this year which does effect our chances of gaining any new technical solutions.
Please don't be surprised if this does not get the attention you would have liked, but I will still take a good read of everything.
Kind regards,
Mike


Hi Anna,
I was speaking to our devs and how they're looking for the next while. Introducing a new process is going to be a bit of a stretch for the next 6/8 weeks as they work to get us in a good position on our core functionality.
I genuinely do see us using Audi in the near future but it's just not in the immediate timeframe. I'll be in touch when we're looking to do a 2 month demo. (I would hope October/November).
All the best,
Bill


Hi John,
We're waiting for feedback from Mike so no update as of yet. Hopefully we should have something for you next week.
Have a good weekend!
Anna


Hi Alexander,
Thanks for this, and it could work well.
We're just in the process of improving our automated test suite, and we'd like to get this work complete before we go ahead with the trial, so I'll be in touch when we're ready.
Best,
John


Hello David,
John passed your recent email to me. We've recently engaged another UX testing company, Kia, to do an initial pilot test of our site.
I found your site very interesting and can see some similarities, and some differences, to what WUD do. And clearly you do it at a different scale. I can also see that you're particularly strong on app testing. We don't yet have a mobile app, just a mobile friendly version of our website.
Can we leave it that I will contact you if our situation changes?
Kind regards,
Amy


Hi Dave,
Thanks for contacting.
Although QA is one of the most important things, we are not in this direction right now. In future we will be interested in UX testing I guess. I'll write you back.
Thank you.
Mike


Yes, but not immediately.
John


Hi Anna,
I have done not enough market research to take up a position on this matter so far.
I would rather not answer your question without a reference point.
Best regards,
Bill


Still working on it.


I'm away now for a couple weeks, then I've got a super busy end of year.
I can see how you'd work for us though as I've used similar folks in the past with great success.
Thanks for putting yourself on my radar .
Carl


Apologise the phone is playing up. I have to jump on another meeting shortly but thanks for the call it's been very helpful. I will discuss it with the management and get back to you may we wish to proceed. Thanks
Regards


hi Ben,
I'm really sorry, we are very busy at the moment as we got a big issue, this is actually going on favor of the missing testing situation inside the company, but we still need at least this week to fix the issue.
After that I'm ready to talk with you again.
very sorry again I didn't mean to hang up the call


Hi John,
We are all set in terms of QA at the moment but things might change in the future. Can you please contact me again early next year to discuss further?
Thanks,
Mike


Yes, we may have opportunities in future.
Regards
Ben


Hi Amy,
We have been going through some changes so have been a bit slow on replying. Thanks for the offers but for now not needed. If we decide to do anything I will let you know.
Thanks and have a good week,
John


Hi Carl,
Really sorry about the delay.
Let me introduce you to Anna, who is working in our Finance and will be the best person to give you the update on this.
Anna, I am sure this is on your radar, but maybe we can give Carl a date?
Thanks,


Thanks John. I'll be in touch and let you know what we decide to go ahead with.
- Ben


Dear Bill,
Thanks for your feedback, currently we will wait until payment gateway integration done then we may run another security test
BR


Hi Mike,
Still nothing yet.
Speak soon.
Regards
Alexander


I can pay someone to do it full time for Â£2-3k, then promote them as they expand their skill set around their product.
We will raise again in Q2 next year, when money isn't so much of an issue and I just need scale we can pick up again then.
Cheers,
Bill


Thank you Amy for you time and attention.
I will come back to you asap in order to confirm our skype call for next week.
Best regards,
Ben


You should have received an invite - please let me know if you didn't.
Thanks


Hi Anna,
Many thanks for this. We will review and revise the draft SOW accordingly.
Best wishes,
John


Hello,
I will do in the first weeks of April,
best regards,


Hi Mike,
Many thanks for putting the proposal together quickly.
I will read and share with Shaun. We will comeback to you.
Best Regards,
Ben


Hi Carl,
Thanks for your email regarding the Kia contract.
We will have a look at the amended order form and will provide our feedback shortly.
Best regards,
Anna


Thank you. I will have this ready by the time you come back. We can discuss on follow up questions you might have.
-Have a great time.
Thanks


Thanks David, but I would rather not schedule another commitment at this stage.
John


Hi, we're aware of the time frame and will be in touch shortly.
Thanks!
Anna, John \- please schedule with Amy and Ben, allowing for us to sit down before together to recap the experience with Skoda.


Hi Mike,
Thank you for your email. I've been out of the office since Thursday and today is my first day back in the office. We will review this today and will let you know our comments later today.
Many thanks
Bill


Hi Alexander,
Thank you for reaching back. Things are currently changing at Audi and I will soon not be responsible for IT anymore. My replacement has not be chosen yet but he'll be the one making decisions on QA. I suggest that you reach back in one month, I'll probably be able to direct you to the right person then.
Thanks & regards,
Dave


Hi Ben,
Thanks for getting in touch and for your email. I'll check it out and try to get an update on the project and where it stands. I'll give you a shout once I know more.
cheers,
Bill
