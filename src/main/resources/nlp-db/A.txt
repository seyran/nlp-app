Hey Mike,
So you'll be coming in person too! Great - I didn't realize!
We can certainly meet at 4 but a room with screen etc won't be available until 4.30. I'll see if I can beg a room from someone, but if not can we work with that?
Thanks,
Joe

Look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.
Thanks
Jim


Hi Mike,
Sorry for being Radio Silent for so long, I have had a prolonged period off work and then we've also been going through some massive changes again with regards to transformation of our department.
However Mark did ask me about this again today, and it looks like we might be in a position to start considering it once again. We could have a quick chat perhaps this week? I am also working with another two senior QA's at the moment let me try and catch up with Mark in the next week or so then have a call with you and the other two QA's to try and get some traction on this again.
Hope you're well.
James


Hi Dominic,
Sure, we'll get you the journeys this week no problem.
And yes, I'm flying out tomorrow morning and will be returning Friday evening around 9pm. I'll be with my boss Rick as we are due to meet ABC GmbH who are the company that write the personalisation software behind our website (http://google.com/). We have a long relationship with them so we meet in Berlin at least once per year.
We are staying at:
Sanddorn Hotel Berlin.
Gotzkowskystrasse 13, Berlin, Germany,
10555.
Will should be free on Friday from 15:00 if you could meet us nearby the hotel? I'm sure my boss would be happy to meet you.
Thanks,
John


Hi Mike,
Sounds interesting but a little bit earlier in our timeline.
Can we set a date for a conference call mid October?
Best regards,
Sam


Hi Jess,
Thanks for this - let's stick to a call at the time we suggested, if there is any synergies happy to meet at a later date.
Thanks again.
Regards.
Gustavo Ahmed


Hi,
I arrive back next week Friday so let's look at 24th/25th.
Thx
Gustavo Ahmed


Mike,
Any chance we could talk tomorrow? Thursday is rather booked, especially during the morning hours EST.
Or, tell me what type of information you need to evaluate/estimate a QA testing project and I'll gather and send to you.
Steve


I'll check for the 28th.
If it's available should I book it?
If it's not is the 22nd doable?


Great. I will do. I am away next week.but would be good to catch up the following week if you are available.


Hi Mike,
Matthew and Lucas have meetings in the morning.
What about 2PM UK time on Monday?
Tks


Hi Mike,
Now I cant .
How about interval between 13.00 - 14.00 GMT+2 ?
Regards,


Monday at 11.0h it's a good option.
Or Tuesday at 10:00h. as you want.
(Monday at 10:00h I'm in a meeting).
Regards,


Hi Mike.
Perhaps we could schedule something in for next week. In the mean time I will take a look at the video you sent me. I've copied in Alexander Kennedy, our QA Manager.
Kind Regards

Hi Mike,
yes, Friday at 4pm is great!
Andreas Dutschke


Hi Mike, would tomorrow 13:00 UK time work for you?
Regards


Hi Mike,
Thank you for your email and sending the updated contract.
At 3pm today would work for us. Could you send us an invitation?
Best regards,


Hi Mike,
I have a few projects that are in flight that may offer us a few different options on where to start a pilot. They are each a bit different, so worth talking over to see what you would need from us and get an understanding of the first steps.
Tomorrow or Friday I have some time available, 1200 tomorrow, or 1100 Friday.
I'd expect to need a follow-up or two next week as well, but this might be with other team members that are more closely involved with the projects.
Thanks,
Erik.


Hi Mike,
Could we talk. I have mobile app due to launch and need some app testing to be completed in China against some obscure OS version.
I'm available this afternoon for a chat.
Thanks,
Ella


Hi Mike,
Could we make it 15.0 - 16:00.
Thanks,
John


Hi Mike.have been at our office in Stoke for last two days so has been difficult to make time for this chat.
Could you schedule something in for week after next?
Kind regards,
Dave


Let's say Wed April 6th. Realized I'll be taken a 2 week holiday in March but unsure exactly when.


Hi Dominic,
I have a meeting with Ella and a few of our Architects on Tuesday.
Would be good to catch up Wednesday.
Cheers,
Ethan


October will be better for us,
Tell me your slots, and i could arrange something.


Mike,
Hope all well. I would like to schedule a conf call with Google to bring everyone up to speed on this project. Jed, our CTO until recently, has left the firm and Dave and Patrick are steering the ship now. So I would like to bring everyone onto the same page before we do any testing.
Wednesday 1pm UK/2pm Berlin time.
Could you please bring from your side who may be involved at this stage.
Thanks & Kind regards,
Jackson


Hi Mike,
Thanks for the screen-grabs. Yes, our budget would stretch to that if we think it's the right solution for us.
Great, so shall we say 4pm on Thursday?
Thanks,
Alex


Hi,
Are you based in the UK? 7pm your time appears to be 5am mine which is a tad bit early. I can do 6.30am onward NZST.
Is there another day this week that could work for you?
Thanks,
Ling


Keep pushing, maybe you'll find the unlikely solution for us .
And Monday we'll make time the earliest slot you can offer us.


Hi Can you please plan it Friday afternoon?
Best regards,
Alexander


Hi Mike,
Many thanks, confirmed for 3pm and updated the calendar invite.
Regards,
Alexander

Hi Mike,
I will be available for a call end of next week.

Harper Drewery


Hi,
Sorry for the late reply, had some guys on vacation and needed to confirm with them as well.
Thursday the 15th at 10.30 works fine for us.
Best,
Maria


Mike,
Let's go for the Proof of Concept! I'm really happy to start working with you guys.
We can set a call tomorrow and discuss the details. I will try to send you all the info in the morning. Can we have a call maybe at 14.0?
Thanks in advance.


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting in touch and sorry for the late reply. I am currently in Asia following manufacturing. As you can imagine this is a very busy time for us, but I'd be happy to arrange a chat for Mid of October when I'll be back in London. Would this work for you?
Thanks,
Falko


Hi Mike,
Please can you send calendar invite to Victoria and myself con-call details for next Tuesday May 3rd at 5-30 pm CEST?
We can then discuss both our business models / goals and explore opportunities for collaboration.
Regards,
Dan


Hey Mike,
So sorry, somehow happened to not send out the mail I typed out. Yes yes 3 PM CET is absolutely okay with me.
Apologies once again.
Victoria


Hey,
Thanks for the update. I'm available on Tuesday. We'd also like to make sure that we get another build tested before the 23rd. Victoria has been trying to make contact but to no avail.
Thanks,
Ben


Hi Mike,
The phone line is diverted through to my mobile at present, because I am out of the office. When I tried to answer your call, it just hung up - sorry!
Given the price indications I got from your website, I tend to think it highly unlikely that we could afford your services at present. I'm afraid, we are a start-up company and very strapped for money right now.
That said, it would be good to better understand the services you offer and if you still think it worthwhile having a chat, I'm happy to arrange something at a fixed time when I am at my desk - maybe sometime this afternoon?
Cheers,
Victoria


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your mail below.
Would it possible to schedule phone meeting in for next week?
Best number to reach me on is 0213 527 1574.
Many Thanks
Grace


Hi Karl, Hi Dominic,
also adding Grace, our Head of PM and Lucas, our CTO.
How about Thursday 15 pm this week at our office?
We are on the opposite site in the Office Fear GmbH.
Let me know.
Best,
Max


Hi Mike,
Yes, can we please schedule a call? I am on SAST time and tomorrow would be great if you have availability.
Thanks,
Emily


Hi Dominic,
Next Monday sounds good. Is 3pm OK? If so I'll send out an invite.
Regards
Joned


Hi Mike, today at 2.15 would be great. Shall we Skype? My add is amy.bare.
Thanks,
Amy


Hi Mike,
Could you please let me know if we are still going ahead with next week demo.
Regards,
Amy


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting back to me. As I mentioned I will be speaking to the COO about the service you can provide.
Unfortunately, our office will be closed this Friday. Probably best to speak next week at some point.
Regards
Amy


Dear Mike,
I am traveling this week. Let's touch base the following week.
Best regards,
Amy Rocens


Hi Mike,
Will you be at the National Software Testing Conference later this month? I see Google has a booth.
Would be a good opportunity to catch up.
Regards.
Ann Perry


Hi Dominic,
Thank you for reaching out to me. I am very keen in your product, and would like more insights about it.
I am also free today until 12pm. Shall we have a call at 10.0am?
Looking forward to hearing from you.
Kind Regards,
Aiden Calderon


I can make 12 work.
How about we join on video using VideoProf? I'll send you an invite.
Cheers


Hi Mike,
Yes you have got the right person.
Looked at your website - and yes would be happy to have a chat on what we do and whether you could help.
I am around most of the rest of this week, Nairobi next.
Best regards,
Aiden


Hi Dominic, I could speak now or at 4pm?


Hi Mike,
I was in the office for the call but my Director called me at 9:25 for a catch up after a recent visit to Morocco, apologies that I couldn't take the call.
Monday and Tuesday next week are not ideal for me; could we do next Friday instead - same time?
Best regards,
David


Hi,
Sorry have sessions it that time slot


Hi Mike,
Please add me to Skype
Can we have a call later this week? Thursday same time as today's ?
Luis


Hi Mike and thanks for the follow-up. Today sometime between 2 and 4. Or tomorrow during the same.
Best,
David


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email. Yes a lot has changed and yes I would be interested in a follow up call - although could you pencil in your diary to contact again around mid-august please?
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
OK, no problem, I had a problem with laptop, but I fixed it already.
May be also today, at 19.00 GTM+2 ?
Regards,


Hi Mike,
Yes, this would be interesting for me.
Can we arrange sometime next week? I would prefer in the afternoon.
Yours sincerely,
David


Hi Mike,
It was nice meeting you at MWC, and many thanks for following up. Yes let's get into more details in a conference call. My schedule this week is quite full. Is next Wed (3/9) OK with you?
In the meantime, I'm looping in our QA leader, Samuel. He will send you our requirements on app testing before the call.
David


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the delay, more than happy to chat next week.
Briefly, we do utilize QA and extensive UAT on our sites but its usually more so on the event sites MWC & MWC Shanghai. The event app is managed by our ops team with my advice/input and that is QA via the developers themselves alongside our teams.
Equally, we conduct stringent security tests weekly on the sites and obviously during the development of the apps. I can explain more about the builds and timelines when we talk.
I'm free all next Wednesday or alternatively Thursday morning?
Regards
Owen


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your quick response.
Would 9.30 on Monday work? How long do you think we should set aside?
Thanks,
Alex


Could u call me now I have ever about 30 minutes?


hi Mike, can we do it on Monday afternoon?


Hi,
3pm is good for me.
Regards,


Hi - can we do 12pm this Thursday?
Thanks,
Mike


Hi Mike,
How does Thursday at 4pm GMT suit?
Thanks,
Owen


Hi Mike,
Apologies that I could not make it for the last time, I will be available for a call in the week starting from 21st November. I will be busy next week.
Kind Regards,
Owen


Hey All,
Is this all arranged for tomorrow at 1pm then?
Alexander Do you need me to attend?
Cheers,
Owen


Hi Dominic,
Good holiday? Things pretty busy here. I have some basic stuff to sort out here as a result of my reviews. Still interested in Crowd Test but need to address these first. Can you drop me a line 1 July to see how I'm getting on?
Thanks
Robert


Sorry something urgent just came up. are you available at 15.0 UK time?


Hi Dominic,
Thanks for reaching out!
How about Thursday 10.30am? Our CTO David Carter CCd will also join the call.
Best,
Michael


Hi Mike -
Apologies for my late reply. It is indeed a crazy time.
Can we schedule a call next week?
Many thanks.
Best regards,
Jayden


Hello Mike,
I'm sorry for the delay to response to your mails.
Indeed, we had a lot of working effort recently and it was impossible to follow any request out of our working scope.
Maybe we can have a short conversation but from January it will be more convenient for me.
I checked the link you sent you and thanks for the interest.
Best,
Zoey


Hi Mike,
I am so sorry for the lack of response! I am super busy at the moment but I could take a call on Friday at 0800 if that works for you?
I look forward to hearing from you.


Hi Mike. Can we get something in the diary for the week after next?
I'm on leave next week but testing is a priority for me so keen to talk).
Best Zoey


No problem. Monday 1.0pm is perfect.


Hi Mike,
Thank you for getting in touch with me, sorry for the late reply but I have been traveling and did not have access to my emails. I won't be back till next Wednesday, so maybe we can arrange a meeting after 28th .
Thanks.
Zoey


Hi Mike,
Would be good to have a call with your legal team to review together some topics. Are we able to get a slot for tomorrow's morning 15th Jun? Alternatively, we can set a call for next Tuesday or Wednesday all day (21st or 22nd Jun, respectively). Please let us know your availability.
Thanks in advance.
Zoey


Hi Mike,
Can we this meeting anytime after 11 AM.
Thanks,
Zoey


Thanks Mike, that's very helpful. We will have a look through the docs and come back to you but very happy to have a call to discuss the location point. Just one other point to mention on the testers, they all need to be 18 or over as well. Again happy to discuss on a call.
I'm free tomorrow after 4pm, Tuesday 10-12 or 3-6 or Wednesday any time after 12.
Kind regards,
Zoey


Hi Mike,
No worries.
09.0am on Friday should be fine at this juncture; speak then.
Best regards,
Zoey


Hi Mike -
Thank you for your answer. This week I will not be able to make it (I will be traveling and difficult to get hold of)., I meant the following week in my email. Is it possible on your end?
Thanks


Hi Mike,
When would it be possible to have a quick chat? I believe we have a challenge that you could help with. Just to provide a brief overview, we are launching a new ecommerce website, 100% focused on a single brand. This website is based in our platforms and APIs, and is a web adaptive application (a single web app targeting 3 formats - regular web browser, web mobile and web tablet).
I believe this could be a good proof of concept as we would like to test:
multiple platforms (desktop, mobile and tablet);
multiple languages (although not 100% mandatory);
exploratory testing as the test case specifications are still under creation;
How could we explore this scenario? I believe our past conversations apply, but would be good to have a conversation around how can we set this up, methodology, costs, etc.
I'm available in the following slots:
Thursday 17th, 9.00 - 11.00;
Friday 18th, 14.00 - 16.00;
Thanks in advance!
Riley


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the delay in response!
Yes, let's get some time in to catch-up and discuss the opportunity. I am free either Tuesday or Wednesday next week at 11am GMT if either days work?
Thanks,
Riley


Sorry Mike.
Been super busy fund raising- if 10.30am UK time is still good for you then I'll chat to you then


Hi Mike,
No worries, I have just dialed out and won't have time to cover now, Can you please postponed the meeting to later this week.
Regards,
Riley


Hey Dominic,
Tomorrow after 3pm works best if you are available for that.
Best,


HI Mike,
I'm afraid that end of Feb is the earliest I can do. Traveling until mid Feb.
Sorry about that.
Looking forward to catching up with you then.
Best,


Sure, +22 9 5558943 is my number.
Thanks,
Ling


Hi Mike,
Good to meet you too. I am very interested in your crowd sourced QA. My week is looking pretty busy I'm afraid, I have time from 12:00-14.0 and 15:00 onward on Weds if that suits, otherwise Thursday morning or Friday afternoon look OK. I'm out of the office the following week, so it would be good to catch up and get things moving before then.
Thanks,
Riley O'Rourke


OK thanks none of the times you suggested work, sadly.
Friday 18th noon works right now
Ben Plans.
CEO


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting back to me. I'm free during the afternoons from 2pm - 6pm GMT tomorrow and Friday. Any chance of a call then?
Regards,
Riley


I'll call you this afternoon.


Hi Mike,
I've presented this to our COO and FD to get their input. I'm out of the office Monday and Tuesday next week, so I've asked if they can get their thoughts together for Wednesday. I'd hope at that point to be able to say what our next step are.
Thanks,


I'm not, I am actually away that week, can we try something on the 10th or 11th?


Hi Mike, Tues is best, thanks
R


Thursday morning is the only time I can't make - can we try Friday morning? Say 10 am?
Aria


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email - you are quite right in remembering our conversation! : ).
If we could pencil in a time for discussion towards the end of next week that would be more convenient for me if that's possible please?
Kind regards,
Ad.
Aria Bird


Hi Mike,

Yes I'm available for 30 min or so at 4pm today. Would you be able to call me on 06323 666008.
Thanks
Aria


Hi Mike,
Sorry - running late. Are you still okay for now?
Aria


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting in contact - I've currently been swamped with deadlines.
If you could drop me an email again next Monday, I should have a little more time on my hands and would be keen to organize a time to discuss Applause and how you could potentially help us in the future.
Cheers,
Sebastian


Hi Dominic,
Apologies for the lack of response to the below. I am still interested however the ladybirds has been very busy and stretched in terms of staffing within our department.
I am away at the moment but would be happy to arrange a call for the second week in October.
Kind regards,
Sebastian


Hi Alan,
Actually I am off from today till rest of the year. But I am happy to take call at 10.0 today.

Hi Dominic,
Thanks for the note, looking forward to chatting tomorrow.
Cheers


Mike,
I have a window Tuesday between 2 - 3pm or from 4 - 5pm if that is any use
Sebastian


Hi,
Sure, Monday or Tuesday morning your time next week is fine.
Thanks,

Hi Mike,
Yes, I am the right person to talk to, but it's a little early yet. Could you get back in touch early February to discuss BMW?
Thanks,
Sebastian


Tomorrow at 10am any good?
Sebastian Elder


Hi Mike,
Are you coming to Web summit in Lisbon?
Feel free to visit us on our booth (B-275, in the BETA Exhibition Area of Pavilion 3) on the last day of the event, Thursday 10th of November.
Best Regards,


Friday. 9.15 start if that works for you.
H


sure, please go ahead and send and invite with a short brief as well please.
Best.
Sebastian


Hi Mike,
Thanks for this. Would we be able to chat next week?
Sebastian


HI Mike,
My colleague, Joseph Doe, passed on your information.
I'm interested to know a little more about the services you offer, though this isn't something on our road map for 2016.
Would you have any availability in mid-late February for a quick intro call?
Best Regards,
Dan


Hi Mike,
Sorry for not getting back to you earlier. I have been traveling lately and I'm very bad with emails .
What about we set up an initial call for early Jan?
Cheers,
- Joseph


Hi Dominic,
That would be great. I will be joined by a colleague Mick Deer from my side.
Speak at 4pm.
Regards
Joseph


Sure, how about tomorrow at 11.30?
Joseph


Hi Dominic,
I am sorry about that. Please call me on my mobile 03318377.
Kind Regards,
Joseph


I can do 3.0 to 4.0.
That work for you Mike?
R


Hey Dominic!
Yep, give me a call on 01242 269092 .


Hi Mike,
For same unknown reason we lost you, here is my direct line 09425 552961.
Kind Regards
Joseph


Hi Mike,
Sorry for the late response. Wednesday at 1500hrs will be suitable for us. If you could send us both a meeting invite on here that would be much appreciated. Tobias has asked me to pass on his email but only for this meeting and nothing else. [ben.geard@bmwgroup.com](mailto:ben.geard@bmwgroup.com).
Kind Regards,
Joseph


Hey Mike,
No problem! These things happen (happens to me a lot haha!).
We are still looking into what possibilities there are for us in expanding our testing capabilities. As mentioned previously we have a large internal QA department, but no experience with automated testing. I have extensive experience with localization and manual testing within the games testing, but this area is relatively new to me, and I would like to discuss it further.
Ideally we would like to be in a position to offer this as a service and be able to get automated specialists such as yourselves to handle that part of the entire testing cycle for our clients that require it.
I'm a little tight on time over the next few weeks, but we could schedule a call W/C 4th July, as I'm away next week and the week after at shows, plus I'm the only one currently looking into this on our end, so bear with me). I'll let you know specifics closer to the time?
Thanks,


Hi Dominic,
I'm at my desk for the next 15 minutes, if you're free?
Thanks
Gabriel


Thanks, but I won't be at the office at that time, let's catch up over the phone?
Regards


I am with customers until Wednesday happy to talk after that.
Best Regards,
Gabriel Dent


I'll be there from Sunday to Sunday, so let me know when you've got some time.
We can chat then and I can explain what I mean .
Gabriel


Hi Mike,
Thanks a lot for sending this. Its certainly interesting.
Any chance we could reconnect by the end of Feb? We should be in conditions to consider this after that date.
Best regards,


Yes, busy. We could be interested next year. Please contact me again in March.


Hi Mike,
Yes we are based in our main office in Vauxhall. We can meet here in our office at 11:00 AM on 22nd November.
Kind regards,
Gabriel


Hi Mike,
I expect to be able to send you the signed contract tomorrow so if we could schedule a kick off call for early next week that would be great.
Regards


Hi Dominic, Sam,
I am in meetings for much of Wednesday but can certainly make any time Friday (and indeed throughout Thursday afternoon). To make the call as productive and efficient as possible, it would be great if the Applause team could send across comments on the draft in good time ahead of the call to consider and discuss internally before hopefully finalizing on the call itself.
Let me know if Friday doesn't work.
Best wishes,
Gabriel


Hi Mike,
Sorry, it's been a busy couple of weeks.
Should we have a chat by the end of the week (maybe Thu/Fri) so we can connect and understand what you guys offer?
Cheers,
Gabriel


Hey guys,
I am available tomorrow between 11 am and 1 pm UK time. Feel free to pick a time in that time frame that suits you.
Thanks,
Andreas


Hi Mike,
0830 is fine. Speak to you then.
Best,
Gabriel




Hi Dominic,
Thanks for sending the proposal through. We have a couple of questions around it, could we set up a quick call tomorrow or Friday to address them?

Hi Mike -
It has been a difficult week as my business partner lost his father. We are now rushing to finish off everything before Xmas. Shall we reschedule it next week? It will be much easier for me. Would Monday 21st at 10am be convenient for you?
Apologies for this late rescheduling.
Many thanks.

Anthony
