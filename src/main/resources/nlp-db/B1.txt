Thanks Bill. At this point, it isn't right for us. Ring us back middle of next year as we hit a new phase of growth.
Thanks
Jason


Hi Gale,
Thanks, it's been a challenge and we're still working through things, so I'm afraid now isn't the best time catch up again. But rest assured that you are still firmly on my radar for when things change.
Cheers,
Carl


Thank you but we will pass for now.
Thank you
Joseph


Hi Ruben,
I have got no interest, thank you.
Best,
Kate


Hi Michael,
thank you for your message and sorry I couldn't answer your call.
I was just checking how much BMW testing solutions could cost, as a part of general research.
We have currently no plans for using them, but this may change in rather distant future (I am talking 6-18 months from now).
Thank you for your time, however I don't need further assistance right now.
Best regards,
Ben


Hi Amy,
We have reviewed all the agencies and compared what we need versus resources on both ends and have decided that although Audi offers a lot of great options, we feel that our website just does not generate enough unique hits to justify using such a large company.
Thank you so much for taking the time to run me through your system should we expand and get popular enough to upgrade our testing solution I will be in touch!
Regards,
John


No thanks


Hi Mike, no thanks.
Alexander


Hi John,
We're not looking to outsource this currently.
Lets connect on LinkedIn though for if that changes in the future.
Ben


Hello James,
I appreciate the message, however I am not longer an employee at Tesla, for whom I was originally investigating testing.
So no, probably not interested in pursuing this further.
But thanks for the offer.
Dave.


Hi,
Thanks, but no, thanks.
Best,
Sander


No thanks


Hi,
We are mainly focusing on developing our first product Pipps (the message experience app), but there are other products in our company portfolio. When Pipps is ready to conquer the world and launch in somewhere else than Finland, I'm sure we are thinking our QA needs again.
- Ben


Hi Bill,
Thanks for getting in touch but I'm afraid this is not a service we are interested in.
Thanks,
Rick


Hi Alexander and apologies for the delay in responding.
We're going to trial an offering from Tesla but let's keep in touch.
Best,
Dave


Hi Ben,
We have already received several proposals from your company and my manager has reviewed them. While from the functional side your offer is very attractive, your price, unfortunately, does not fit our projects budgets.
We will keep you in mind and will turn to your assistance if we see it fits our purposes and budget.
Thank you again for your offer and good luck!
Best regards,
Amy


Hi John,
We're not building mobile apps right now, but will take a closer look if we do.
Thanks,
Amy


Hi Bill,
My apologies for the delayed response, we were very busy testing our software actually. I appreciate you reaching out but we are currently conducting all our testing in house with additional out of offices testers from our community. The reason for this is because we are able to make development changes very quickly so doing it in house gives us the fastest turnaround at this given time. We will likely be scaling up our testing procedures soon so I will definitely keep you in mind should our needs change.
Kind regards,
Alexander


Hi,
I just checked what kind of things you have to offer and if it would fit to our future needs of QA. I'll contact you if we are outsourcing testing.
Sincerely,
John


We have our own internal testing teams so we are not interested.
Please remove my details from your database.
Thanks,
Ben


Hint: in 95% of cases it means not interested. Please remove me.


Hi Carl,
Thanks for your email. We're not in a position to start outsourcing this yet but we may be later in the year. I have added you to our review list and I'm sure we will be in touch with further questions when the time comes.
Many thanks, Bill


Hi Alexander,
Not ready to look into this yet. Will shout when we are.
Many Thanks
Jay


No need at this time.


No thanks.
Regards,
Carl


Hello Amy,
Sorry, really not interested I'm afraid.
Best,


Hi Bill,
Many thanks for reaching out. Unfortunately this is not something we are currently interested in pursuing. However please don't hesitate to reach out again in the future.
Kate


Thanks John.
The service looks great but given that the cost is about 10x what I might consider I'll file this under "for later.".
Regards,
Ben


OK, so as a rule we don't deal with external companies for recruitment or dev/qa solutions.
We deal with everything in house.
We appreciate your contacting us but i every much doubt that we will be following up with any requests for work, unless of course you offer it for free!
Cheers,
Bill


Please remove me from your contact list


Hi Amy,
Thanks for your note but we are not looking for these services.
Best regards,
Dave


we don't deal with externals.
all the best


Not interested.


Hi Gale,
Unfortunately we can't proceed with the POC or contract. Our test data is copied from Production and even though we anonymise all the test data the actual client logos don't change and our legal representative isn't happy about that.
Thanks so much for all your efforts!
Best regards,


not interested, many thanks.
best,
David


Hi Mike,
Thanks but it's too soon as we do not have any apps. I was just seeing what was out there.
But keep me informed.
Regards
Carl


Maybe not. sorry. Trying to get a hold of the John at Audi.


Hi Ben,
Sorry for not responding but I left Tesla 2 weeks ago!
Best,
Bill


Hi,
Sorry for the lack of response - It's a communication of a number of factors.
Unfortunately we are not looking for any further testing resources at the moment. My role does include a small amount of recruitment input, however much of it is provided by our technical leads, who already have in place contracts for outsourced work.
Thanks again for your interest.
Mike


Hi Amy,
I have been politely ignoring your continued sales emails, as I have no interest in your service, I am happy with my existing offshore QA.
Please don't bother me any more,
John


Thanks Ben, but I will politely decline.
Many thanks.
Carl


Hi John,
Thanks but I have received all your emails - we will be in touch once we have determined who we want to partner with or if we require more information.
I have a QA team - please do not send any more emails as we have your details on record.
Regards
Mike


Q/A is something we want to build in house.
Being a banking app, any simulated activity does not work.
PII and data security regulations.
-Bill


We have our own in house test team and engineers.
John


David,
Thanks for email but having reviewed your offer I have decided not to proceed any further with same.
Regards and thanks.
Gale


Hi Alexander,
Thanks for your email. The team here have decided to start a trial with a separate testing company.
The other company were more flexible on pricing (allowing us to take 1/2 days as and when we need then rather than committing to a full year). Also they offered us pen testing which was useful.
Like I say this is a trial with the other company so lets keep in touch. One thing the other company didn't offer was in house UX (i.e. A/B testing new features with user interviews and feedback sent to us) so that's something we might look for in the future.
All the best,
Carl


Thank you will pass on this for now


Not interested - thanks


Hi Ben,
Thank you very much for your invitation, but I'm working at Ford - London office. Therefore, I cannot be there, I'm sorry.
King Regards,
-Amy


Hi John,
Thanks for emailing, we are not currently looking for any help in this area.
Best,
-Mike


Hi Gale,
We have some user mechanics for our website in mind. But we need to develop it first. Once it's done we will consider UX testing.
Thanks.


Hi Carl,
I looked into this and for this moment we do not have anything that would be applicable to use your service for.
Thanks for reaching out.
Regards,


Hey Mike,
Thanks for all your many different contact points.
We are perfectly happy with our current provider.
Please do not contact me or the team further,
Alexander


Hi John, apologies for the lack of reply. We already have a local partner that we use for testing our releases, but when we next come to that stage I will keep you in mind if there are any issues.
Kind regards,
Amy


I appreciate the cookies but that technique holds no weight with me. Nice try but no thanks Andrew, take me off your crm hit list.


We have a really good testing process in place as it is.
Thanks though,
John


Hi Ben,
Thanks for answering all of the questions.
We have decided to run the next scripted load/performance/benchmark testing with our current provider.
The reason is not because what you are offering isn't appealing, it's just we feel we haven't had enough experience with them to judge and move away after just one testing period.
I am still going to keep the fact you have real-user testers on the back-burner because it may be that a bespoke project may arise where we need that kind of resource.
Please leave me, Brett and Rob on any email lists with regards to new features and solutions Skoda release/offer as its good for us to be aware of developments.
I just don't want to take too much of your time until we know we can use the resources you provide. We can tell you are keen to work with us which is great to see and it sounds very much like you have the technical abilities to work with our website personalisation features. However we're going to be heavily occupied with Christmas trading and then immediately Valentine's trading early Feb and won't be able to give time to new solutions until that has passed.
I hope that is all understandable,
Any questions, let me know,
Mike


Hi Carl, thanks for your email - I'm afraid we don't really have the budget for additional IT resources/services until Q2/3 next year although please feel free to contact my colleague Charles Holmes around that time as he is better placed to discuss further.
Best, Bill


We are not interested at this stage. I will contact you if this changes.
Gale


Hello Amy,
All well thank you- no, not yet.
John


Hi Ben,
All our testing is kept in house and we have no plans to outsource this at present.
I will let you know if this changes.
Best,
Dave


Hi David,
Good to talk to you too.
I've chatted internally and I'm afraid the cost is just too prohibitive for us so we're not able to proceed.
Many thanks,
John


Hi Bill,
Thanks for your emails.
We are not interested in this product currently since we have many other projects, I will contact you if we are interested to hear more about it in the future.
Regards
Mike


Hi Gale,
Thank you for your email.
At the moment we are not looking for an external testing agency.
But I'll come back to you when we do.
Best,
Alexander


Hi,
At this moment we aren't looking for testing services. We are now focusing on developing our products and soon starting piloting.
Maybe I contact you when we are ready to publish for real and we have needs for more QA. For our needs in Finland we have already the needed resources, but later when scaling up we might need some help.
Sincerely,
Bill


Hi Dave,
It's having time to respond to emails which is the issue!
I have my own testing team and so at this time I've got testing / quality covered.
Thanks for reaching out.
Anna


Hi Alexander,
Thanks for reaching out. We do this in house though, so not a good fit at the moment.
Thanks,


Hi Mike,
At the moment I'm not sure if this is something we need.
Nonetheless, KIA looks like a brilliant business, so would be happy to speak if you were looking to raise a loan for your growth. Not sure if you've had a chance to look at what we do, but just to recap, we are the only crowdfunding platform for businesses that do loans via the new Innovative Finance ISA, which means anyone can invest up to £15,240 through crowdfunding websites and get tax-free returns. That means you can get a loan and your fans make the interest on their investment, rather than the bank. Furthermore, we usually can do lower interest rates than banks.
We are also working to help companies avoid any post-Brexit shock waves by offering a marketing video telling your story, a marketing plan and the ability to tap into the £480bn IF ISA reserves. We believe all private companies should be supported by a team of private investors for the long term.
Let me know if the above is of interest to you.
Best,
Ben


Carl,
Many thanks but this is not a requirement of the movie partnership.
Thank you
Amy


Hi Alexander,
I am sorry that I am extremely busy and have no time to figure how to adopt your product.
Let's keep in touch.
BR
John


Hi Bill,
Thank you for your emails. We currently handle all our testing in house and haven't felt the need to change this so far.
However, things always change so I will keep your details let you know if we get to the stage where we need additional help.
Many thanks,
Carl


Hi Ben,
Thanks for your email but we satisfied with our current approach and processes in this area.
Regards
Gale


Hi Mike,
After sharing with our CEO, he told me that we already have been in contact with you but in our current status we can't afford your services.
Let's see in the coming months.
Bests,
Bill


Thanks for reaching out Gale,
Unfortunately, we don't need any new developers or QAs right now because of budget and our plans. But in case if i would need them I'll contact with you.
Thanks.


Hi,
At this time I don't think there is any value in a further update, but I will keep your details on record.
Thanks v much.
Amy


Hi Bill,
After discussing this, we are not in a position to pursue this any further I'm afraid.
Thank you very much for your time,
Carl


No interest thanks Ben.
Mike


Hi, thanks for your email but this isn't something we are interested in right now.


Hi Alexander,
Thanks for the email and it's nice to meet you. I've had a look at your website and your business looks unique and exciting. Unfortunately the business handles QA internally and it's not something we're looking to work with a 3rd party on right now.
Best of luck with it all though!
Regards,
John


Hi Dave,
Thanks for getting in touch but we're not interested at the moment so please don't email again, many thanks.
Ben


Hello Gale and Ben,
How are you? I hope everything is fine. This email comes in at a perfect timing because I wanted to talk to you about something important. I want this email to be a written notification about our determination to terminate the contract as soon as possible (I guess we won't have to pay for the remaining two months of contract but need your confirmation). There are two main reasons for this decision:
 Your service was always considered as a temporary one. We were setting our own internal QA team that is now up and running
 The level of service has been worsening as months go by at a significant speed. During the last couple of months we reached a unsustainable situation: less and less bugs are reported, critical bugs go unnoticed in your test plans (i.e. 4 expedite review in iOS during the last couple months with severe consequences for the business), repeated bugs and the overall feeling that the services add less value with each test cycle.
I hope you understand our position. No hard feelings but no need to continue this association that now is costing us much more than the value it is adding.
Thanks for your comprehension.
Best,


Not interested, please stop emailing.


Hi Mike,
Many thanks, we're not interested at this point but will definitely keep Ford in mind in the future!
Thanks for getting in touch.
Kind regards,
Ben


Hi Amy,
I am aware of the various e-mails you sent to me and some of my colleagues. This is not for us now.
Regards,
Alexander.


Hi David,
Thank you for your message. At the moment we're focusing on rebuilding our product, therefore, at the moment we wouldn't require your services.
We might get in touch in the future.
Many thanks again and best regards,
Dave


Hi Bill,
No immediate plans - we want to understand the process for us post-test before we move into another one.
Thanks,
Carl


Hi John,
Apologies for the radio silence at this end - unfortunately, development resource has been so tight that we haven't been able to dedicate time to fixing the issues we found. I'm actively liaising with the dev agency to get estimates to fix the issues.
On your service, we're generally very happy with what was provided, with the bottleneck being more at a dev side on our end.
Thanks,
Ben


We are not interested at this time, but if our needs change I will keep your organization in mind.


Thank you, Mike.
The bug has been fixed now and will be pushed through shortly, as for your offer we are OK thanks, we have our own internal QA team .
Best Wishes,


Hi Gale,
My apologies for not getting back to you sooner - bad form.
I appreciate your services and their value, but having merged with the Hassle/Helpling I have also inherited a QA team. Feature throughput at the mo' is also not sufficient to warrant a third party, but I will absolutely keep your details on record and come back to you if / when need arises.
With thanks again for your mail
Ben


Hi Carl,
thanks for getting in touch but we're not in the market for this type of help at this time
Bill.


Hi Anna,
No thanks, that's not something we're interested in.
Amy


The decision was made well above station. John informed me that at this moment in time we are not going to follow up any inquiries with companies I contacted, including yourselves at Audi.
Again, sorry for any inconvenience caused.
Regards,
Ben


Hi Carl,
Unfortunately we are not interested right now.
Regards,
Bill


Hi Mike,
After evaluating the issue with the QA manager we don't think there's an opportunity for cooperation here.
Thanks for your time,
John


Nope, thanks.
bye.


Hi Ben,
We have verbally agreed to go with BMW, purely based on price.
I do appreciate you coming in to present to us a couple of weeks ago and wish you all the best for the future.
Kind Regards,
Anna


Hi,
Realized on reading it that it wasn't what I thought it was so not appropriate for me, thank you.
Regards
Bill


Hi Carl,
I'll keep your details in mind, and at some point I will read the info in the link below - but presently the responsibility for this form of testing is placed on our existing technology partner.
That's not to say we don't also test here, we do, with dedicated roles for UAT as the client; but the formal QA and device testing is something we expect our systems integrator to perform for us.
One thing I ask is that Audi don't continue to market to me, and if I'm interested in the future I'll reach out to you.
I'll be candid, I get so many cold emails from vendors that if I continue to receive marketing materials from a business after I make an initial response, like this one, I simply add the vendor to a blacklist and cease to read them.
Kind regards,
Mike


Thanks but not for us. Best, Amy


amy.dgtyrd@berarfetch.com has declined this invitation with this note:
"Hi Gale, no update unfortunately. Let's skip this one please. Amy"
### berarfetch: Audi catch-up.
Please join my meeting from your computer, tablet or smartphone.


Thanks,
Sorry we are not interested with the product.
Thanks
Mike


Hi Ben,
The main cause is that the price of the tool is very high and at this moment we do not see feasible, but we do not discard for the future, because we considered that it is very interesting.
Regards,


Hello Amy, thank you but I'm not interested.
Kind regards,
Alexander


remove me from the list and everyone else from Tesla


Hi Carl,
I think that you should be kind enough to stop emailing me as requested.
Many thanks
Bill


In our company, every role is responsible for quality. You get fired otherwise.
Anna


hey John,
it's less relevant for now , will get back to u when it will be
Thx


Alexander,
Thanks for providing the estimates for the ongoing trial and the proof of concept POC. Having worked with usability testers in the past, we are more accustomed to paying a couple hundred pounds per test (~£35 per participant, available from at least a dozen different peer-to-peer platforms) than the figures quoted (£100-£250 per participant). We obviously recognize that having participants from the correct demographic is worth paying a significant premium, but are concerned at the size of premium you are charging - especially for the POC.
Our next best alternative is to source 2x the candidates, receive videos on each, eliminate half for failing to meet our targeted demographic, and still have a price that is £35-£180 per participant cheaper than what you are quoting.
We may still be willing to move ahead with a POC to assess just how accurate your demographics are, and would certainly be interested in conducting on-going tests if the test users fall into a markedly better demographic than what we can source ourselves, but would appreciate flexibility in the POC price as well as greater justification in the value your POC will provide above and beyond what we can source for 1/7th the cost.
Having spent a decade project managing technical projects I am ill-inclined to pay a significant premium for the PM work. Having multiple quantitative PhD's accustomed with statistical analysis on the team, I am also ill-inclined to pay a premium for a certified UX person to summarize the raw data for us.
Kind regards,
-Gale


Hi Ben,
Thanks we are mostly B2B and have a QA team, thanks anyway.
Regards,
Carl


Yep you make the report based on how the behavior was. We need the other way around.
So not interested


Hey Bill,
Thanks for introducing your service but I don't think we need it yet.
Thank you,
Anna


Thanks Carl but not one for us right now.
All the best,
Bill


Hi Ben,
Thanks for the email but we have in house QA testers.
Cheers,
John


Hi Mike,
Sorry for the delay. Pretty busy here. I have realized that there are some basic good testing practices I need to get embedded here before I engage with a crowd test supplier. I am still interested in moving forward with some form of crowd testing but it's now a medium term rather than short term goal for us.
Happy to stay in touch.
Regards
Gale


Our product only works with a live feed, with a live website and a live GA account, therefore we can only do very limited testing not in live. We have clients that get a cheaper price to let us test things live in beta. Therefore we have no requirement for an external QA service.
Regards
Bill


apologies Carl.
This went into my Junk folder which I'm only sorting through now.
I have no business requirements for your apps, but thanks for reaching out.
Best,
Ben


Hi Anna,
My apologies for not coming back to you sooner.
Unfortunately, we still do not have a suitable release candidate for external testing.
I will be in touch as soon as we do have one.
Kind Regards,
Alexander


Hi Amy,
We are good for now thanks, our projects regarding this have been canceled.
Cheers


Ben,
Thanks. Had a quick look but not one for us.
Thx


Bill,
I downloaded the paper for personal interest to read on the plane. As a company we do not use external test resources so please remove me from your sales prospect list.
Thanks,
Anna


We have in house QA. We looked at your service last year. And thought it was not anything for us


Hello Ben,
Thanks for your time, I understand what you have to offer. I will make the business aware of your offer and if it is applicable, I will contact you.
Regards
Carl


Hi Amy,
Thank you for getting in touch.
I'm afraid we have made the decision to go with another partner which were more aligned with our needs and requirements as a business.
Thank you for your time and assistance on this matter.
Kind Regards,
Dave


Hi David,
I dot think it's the right fit- thanks.
Anna


Hi there,
I'm sorry I'm not interested in following up right now.
Thanks
John


Hi,
I'm sorry but I'm not interested.
Kind regards


Not interested, thanks.


Thanks for the email Bill, we have our own internal teams and have no plans to outsource. If we change we will keep your company in mind.
Best regards,
Mike


Hi David,
Thank you for your kind mail and you are right I am not interested (in present time) and very busy. In future if I need I'll contact you as I have your details.
Gale


Sorry for missing today's meeting. This week is horrible because there is so many meetings and Slush is on Wed-Thu. Anyway it seems that we aren't at least yet needing outside QA.
Apologize,
Bill


Hi sir,
For the future we might be interested, but currently we're trying to build a tech team, and due to the small size of our solution the product owners does the testing as of now.
Kind regards,


Hi Dave,
Apologies for not getting back to you.
A bit of both to be honest. I will contact you in the future if this change.
Thanks,


Hi Carl,
I was investigating options and this one is way outside the budget for our current project but I will certainly bear you in mind in the future should the need for wider testing arise.
Kind regards,
Mike


Hi Ben - we're not interested in testing suites at the moment.
I will reach out when the time is right.
Thanks


Hi John,
I'm sorry but we are not really interested in that kind of testing. Our product and marketing efforts are now very much into B2B, so we need to be very focused on a small number of prospects. It's possible we could benefit from your crowd testing model, but now we need to be very careful about how we use our scarce resources.
Best regards,
Ben


Hi Mike, I need to skip this one. No update from my side, still, unfortunately.
All the best,
Anna


Unfortunately I can't make it as you know I'm based in London.
Regards
Amy


Hey John,
We're a bit early for something like BMW (non-profit + tiny budget), so we do all our testing in-house.
Thanks,
Carl.


Hi Bill,
Please take me off of your mailing list.
Kind regards,
Anna


Not interested. Thx,
[](http://www.housesheep.com/).
Anna


Unfortunately we have no extra cash available to spend on software/development


Hi there,
Thanks for getting in touch but we're not really looking for anything like this at this stage.
Cheers, Mike


Nice to e-meet you to Andy. This sounds interesting especially from an AR perspective but no something we're considering right now.
I'll be sure to keep your details on our records.
Best,
John


Hi Carl,
Thank you for your time in showing us all the features of your product. Unfortunately, we've spoken to our technical team and it won't be possible to get access to the app's IPA file to do the user testing.
We will keep you in mind for future projects that will allow us to use your services.
Kind Regards,
Ben


I have a daily call at 10.00am. I haven't had a briefing about what we're planning to discuss / agenda. I'm not really in a position to move forward at this point.


Hi Bill,
we're not interested,
thanks for the offer.


Hey Amy,
I spoke with my CFO and we won't have any extra budgets by November.
But overall offer is promising.
Mike


No thanks


Hi Dave,
This is to let you know that management did not approve this request possibly because we cannot afford it yet.
Thanks for your time and info.
We might get back to your services some time in the future
Thanks,
Ben


Oops sorry - missed that last question.
There is another company that we are in discussions with that as it stands we are likely to trial first. But if that falls through, then we are likely to come to you guys.
If we don't go with you this time, we are likely to engage with you in the future to compare services and to choose a preferred option.
Cheers,
Anna


Hey John,
we had a look at your web site and all the services you offer look really good, but at this state of the QA department development we will not take advantage of an external service. We will get in contact with you though if we feel a need for improvements in the overall quality of our products.
Thank you for you email,
Best Regards,
Ben


Hi Amy,
We're not looking for this type of service right now.
thanks, Anna


not interested


Hi John,
No I'm afraid I'm not the right contact - I believe we are quite happy with our testing strategy right now, we've tried a few and for whatever reason they haven't worked as well as doing it in house.
If we change our mind, we'll let you know.
Thanks
Mike


Not interested.


Hi,
I'm obviously not interested.
Thanks
David


We do all our own testing internally. Tks.
Ben


No it's OK we have that side of it completely covered. Thanks.
Amy


Hi Anna,
I think for us since we work so dynamically the vendor we chose gave us the opportunity to work directly with the testers as well as having direct contact at all times with an active team.
Since we are very particular about our needs, we felt that having someone available to us as well as completely happy to change their methods of working to accommodate our "over-agile" development cycles sold it for us.
When I mentioned the size of Audi, it was purely based on the about of cogs turning that could potentially mean a slow uptake where we needed instant help. Not the actual size of the company. I think a solution that Audi provides would be more beneficial for a much larger company (such as the ones in your portfolio) that have hundreds of thousands of visitors a day, we simply aren't that size and as such we chose a company that was happy to be flexible to us in any circumstance.
Thanks for your time and perhaps we'll make contact again in the future as we grow.
Regards,
Amy


Hi Ben,
Thanks for reaching out - we currently have an in-house QA team which we work with. Will keep you in mind for the future, should the need arise.
Thanks


Not interested,
Thanks.
Gale


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email. At the moment we are not looking to test our website as we use a company that does that for us.
Thanks for your interest.
Kind Regards,


Hi -
Thanks for the email, but this isn't for us.
Good luck!


Hi Anna,
We can't commit to any spend, but if you want to work on a purely speculative basis then let me know!
John


Hello Alexander,
Thanks for reaching out.
To be honest I am not sure we could use your in-the-wild testing services. We already have an environment that works just for testing, and we have some team members that are testing our projects. From my point of view, doesn't make sense do pay for a service when we're already doing it in-house.
Enjoy the rest of your day,
Mike


His reply: for 30k a year we can employ a dev who does ONLY testing for us .
Ben


Hi David,
I think it's a bit of both. The budget just isn't there and we can potentially recruit user testers in a less formal capacity for much less through e.g. Tesla.
Thanks,
Anna


Hi,
We've recently reviewed our staffing, and at this point in time we're not looking for additional resource in the test space. We may have a role in the future, perhaps later this year, but we'd be looking to hire an individual full-time if when that need arises.
Cheers,


Hi Carl,
Sorry for the delay in answer to you. Friday we have local holidays and we were not in the office.
The services are very interesting and useful, but at the moment we are not interested in hiring tool. We keep the contact for a possible collaboration in the future.
Thank you for your time.
Best regards,
Bill


A last try deserves an answer. . But just to say that at the moment we are not interested in your service. If, in the future, we do have a need for a product like the one you offer, we will investigate this further.

Hi John,
Thank you for your emails. Apologies about the delay in getting back to you.
This is not something we require at the moment. I have stored your details though and will contact you in future if we need your services.
Many thanks
Carl


No change Bill. We can't afford you at the moment.

Unfortunately that seems unlikely, but never say never!


Sorry, but I don't think we're looking for this service. Please take me off your list.


Hi Gale,
We believe you are too expensive a service - thanks for getting in touch.
Best wishes


Hi Mike,
thanks for the offer, we are currently at stage that we are testing on our own. We were planning some hiring for the beginning of next year for QA and testing department, but I'll have you in mind.
Kind regards,
John

Hi Anna,
Was great speaking with you this morning and I am sorry to have been the bearer of bad news, it was very close between BMW and the company that we have decided to go with for our load testing project. I have your details on file so if it doesn't work out with the chosen company I will definitely be in touch with you.
I would like to thank you for all you time and efforts and hope that you have a fantastic Christmas and New Year.
Kind Regards
John
