Hi Mike,
This afternoon is not good for me.
Can we reschedule to next Friday AM or PM?
Best regards,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
This week is a bit early and we are moving office by end of this month. I am still interested in speaking to you. Please can we touch base early next year as I feel that time would be appropriate and I will have some clarity around requirements.
Many Thanks,


Apologies I can't make the call I'm still on the move in China. It's late on Friday eve. Let's reschedule
Dan


Hi Mike,
Another meeting has been moved so I'm no longer able to attend at 11.30. Can we move it to the afternoon or the next day?
Thanks
Joned


Hi Mike,
I'm terribly sorry, but we are going live with a new system on Monday and everything just popping up now so I am pulled into testing and fixing. will let you know when we can reschedule for.
Thank you
Louise


Hi Dominic,
I'm afraid as suspected I'm going to call a late cancellation. I will be looking at our requirements for a PoC next week so please get in touch when you're back from leave.
Thanks
Rob


Hi Mike,
Sorry for the short notice but I will need to cancel our meeting tomorrow as I need to be available for a new starter.
Let's catch up again next week, I'll review the info you sent me.
Cheers,
Jose


Sorry Dominic, I've been swamped with meetings. It may be best to rearrange when you are back.


hi Mike,
I need to postpone as well, end of the year meeting are longer and deeper than I thought.
Perhaps it's better to move it to tomorrow, are you available?


Hi Mike,
Whilst we agree with your approach for the next call, we do need to have Joe and perhaps other members of our engineering area. Joe is not available all day tomorrow, so can we please look to reschedule it for early next week ?
Thanks
Nollaig Qadir.


Hi Mike, for personal reasons I had to take the last week as vacations and was unable to do any progress on the subscription topic. Can we move to next week please?
Thanks
Luis


Hi All,
Apologies I had to shoot off yesterday, today's not great for me.
How's Tuesday at 11am?

Hello Mike,
I have a meeting everyday from 12 ti 12h30 pm.
If you could reschedule for next Monday afternoon, it will be perfect. Thanks.

Let's reschedule on Tuesday. The same time. 01-00 pm London time.
Please add me on Skype.
Best Regards, Gustavo Ahmed


Hi Mike,
Are we able to reschedule this call for Wednesday anytime after 8am NZST?

Hi Mike,
Can we move this to the same time next week? I'm going to be out of the office this afternoon, and have a busy rest of the week.
Cheers,
Sarah


We are very busy at the moment - can we please postpone for now, and re-schedule in a month or so
Thanks


Morning Mike,
Apologies it's my turn - I've got an unscheduled client visit to make this morning and about to leave the office, can we reschedule for next week please?
Kind regards,


Hi Mike, so sorry but still in lunch. I need to skip this one. I'll send an update shortly.
Sorry :/


Hi Mike,
Sorry, but for several reasons I was unable to meet with the QA lead to select the application for the trial. This week I'll be traveling a good portion of the week, so I kindly ask you to postpone an additional week. Can we do it next week, Monday, same time?
Thank you!
Ben


Hello,
Sorry about this I am still stuck in my 3pm meeting.

Hi Mike,
sorry for such late notice, but I'm running late for our meeting. Can we do it 17.00 GMT today or 14.00 GMT tomorrow (same time tomorrow)?
Thanks and sorry once again.
Luis


Hi Mike,
Sorry, I've had to reschedule. Are you able to do an evening your time? Tuesday evening your time could work for me.
Thanks,


Hi Mike,
I'm sorry again but we'll need to push the meeting about 15 min later if OK for you?
Thanks,
Gustavo Ahmed


Hi Mike,
I'm sorry, but that time doesn't work for Leo.
What about Monday, Mar 27 at 6.0 PM BST? Leo is also available Tuesday, Mar 28 at 10:00 PM BST or Wednesday, Mar 29 at 10:00 PM.
What's the best number for Leo to call?
Amy


Hi Dominic,
Could we do July 15th? As I'm at an event on the 13th and 14th.
Thanks,
Gustavo Ahmed.


Hey,
Sorry - only just seen these. Unfortunately I'm out of the office tomorrow, could we arrange something for Friday?
Cheers,
Tom


Hi Mike, still in meetings, can we move it forward? Would suggest next Monday afternoon as agenda is crazy.
Sorry


Hello Mike,
Launch is good so far,
Yes, I will be in a trip this day, could you do that Thursday 8th or Friday 9th ?
Best regards,


Can we do 11.0 instead tomorrow?
Alexander Kutsch.

Mike,
Apologies something urgent has come up which I need to attend to. Have you got any time either tomorrow or Tuesday next week?
Regards
Alexander


Hi Mike,
Do you mind if we reschedule it for next Friday same time?
Regards,


Hi Mike,
I've got a meeting at 3pm. I can do 2pm or 4pm do either of those times work for you?
Thanks,


Hi Mike,
on Wednesday, I will be on Audi all the day.
Can we talk next week?
Regards,


Hi Mike,
Apologies, I've had another meeting come up, that I sadly can't move.
Can we perhaps reschedule for later in the week please ?
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
Sorry to miss the call, can we push this out to the end of the month?
Many thanks,
Alexander.


Hi Mike,
Thank you very much for the follow up.
Unfortunately we are a bit swamped after the summit and would kindly ask you to post pone out call for next week.
Is that possible?
Best regards,


Hi Mike,
Apologies for being so poorly responsive. It is an extremely busy time for us. I am now back in London and I will need a few days to get back on my feet. Would you be able to reschedule the call for Friday at 3PM?
If it's OK for you George, our Innovation Manager in Cc will join the call too.
Thanks,
Alexander


Mike,
My apologies. Please can we push back the meeting to Tuesday?
I have a significant proposal to complete and get out.
Alexander


Excuse me Mike,
but I was in a meeting and cannot give you the information.
We talk in 10 min.
Thanks.


Looked okay, but could structure it to begin from April 15th or May 1st? I think that would be best given the workload we have here in the coming months.
-Alexander


Hi Mike,
Are you able to make Monday 22 May instead?
Cheers,
Alexander


Oh no! I'm afraid today has become very difficult to make as a few other urgent events have popped up around our time slot that I need to prepare for.
Would you be able to provide an alternative time in that case?
Philip Heiner


Cheers Mike, sorry for constantly shifting it around!


Hi Dominic,
Unfortunately I have a last minute customer visit on Monday and Tuesday, can we reschedule for Wednesday?
Regards
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Just taking 5 minutes out to look at diary - this is probably a more realistic date to pick up our previous conversation as the coming weeks are fully booked and and focus on the products in question, this will be a good time to catch up and discuss a first trial on the first mobile app to be associated with our product line.
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
Sorry for the lack of response on my side. Let me assure you we are really interested in your service and do want to move forward as we have previously discussed. However, last week, I was reviewing again the statement of work you sent and noticed that the price is fixed at 3500 GBP. In the past (early conversations we had), you have mentioned the following:
"Test cases will directly influence the price of the PoC. This works as follows:
Purely exploratory testing: £2,600.
Exploratory testing + 10 test case hours: £3,050.
Exploratory testing + 20 test case hours: £3,500".
As my understanding, the current SoW only includes exploratory testing. Can you please let me know what is causing the change in terms of price? Are we considering any hours of tests cases in this bundle? Additionally, what is the incentive for buying the 5 test cycles at once if the price is the same? If there any discount that can be applied or what should be the minimum of test cycles to be eligible for a discount?
I'm not going to be able to meet today but would suggest to reschedule for later this week (Friday same time works for me).
Thank you,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Unfortunately things have got really hectic here this week so I won't make it to our call later on today,
Apologies for the late update,
Thanks,


Hello,
I had some family problems yesterday so I wasn't at the office.


Sorry Dominic I have a meeting at this time as well until 4.0. I'm free in the morning though.
Cheers


Apologies Dominic, I realize this is very late notice, but is there any chance you'd be able to push our call back to same time tomorrow?
Thanks,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
running behind schedule due to an issue at dinner. I have only just seen the time and I believe Tobias has run over too. We will call ASAP. Hopefully within the next 10 minutes.
Thank you,
Philip Heiner


Sorry Mike, I have only just got back to the office and have a million things to do, so could we schedule something for tomorrow at the same time?
Cheers,
Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,
Apologies but I won't be able to call you today. The day has run away from me and I've something I need to finish before I leave.
Could we speak tomorrow instead please? I have calls and meetings in the morning but should be available in the afternoon.
Thanks
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Can we please push the call to 2.0 (delay it by 30 min)?
Thanks


Hi Mike, sorry I've just rescheduled a meeting to that time. Either before 10.30 or after 12.00 would work for me at the moment.
Many thanks
Philip Heiner


Mike, could you amend to 4pm as I have another call at 3pm,
Thanks


Hi Mike, Hi Adrian,
Really sorry to mess you both around but I'm going to have to re-schedule our call as something's come up. I'm probably going to be playing catch-up for the rest of the week and then I'm out of the office next week so please can we arrange something for 17th, 18th, or w/b 21st?
Apologies again,
Jon


Hi Mike,
Can we delay our meeting tomorrow to Friday please? We have a couple more documents to go through that are still pending to arrive tomorrow afternoon that would be included in the decision making.
I do wish to make contact with a reference of yours to help us make our decision, so if you could get that over to me that would be great.
Thanks!
Philip Heiner


Hello Mike,
I'm sorry to hear you've been ill and hope you're feeling better now. I'm surrounded by people with bad colds at the moment but so far, helped I believe by Audi, I've managed to stay well.
Thanks for the information you've sent, which I will review later. If that's OK, I'd like to defer our conversation until after we've completed our current major release on 21st October. I detect a distinct lack of willingness on the part of our development team to think about anything other than completing the code at the moment!
We have planned a breathing space in our development plans for November which will be a better time for us to consider infrastructure requirements, which I see automated testing fitting into.
So could we plan a follow up call for early November instead please?
Thanks
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Apologies for that, this week has proved a bit more challenging than thought, can we please postpone to after Christmas ?
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
Yes thanks and yourself?
I'm with a client all day today I'm afraid - could we reschedule to next week, potentially the 4th?
Kind regards,
Ad.
Philip Heiner


I have moved on.
We can reset the call to another time.
Its easy to email or phone for the future if you are having issues.
Philip Heiner


hello,
would it be possible to move today's call to tomorrow or Thursday? One of my morning meetings had to be rescheduled for the afternoon and so I will be in meetings all day today.
Kind regards,
Philip Heiner


hi Mike,
I am sorry, but need to shift our call, need to finish smth very urgently.


Hi Mike,
Can we reschedule the call for today for some tue/wed next as I cannot attend today.
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Also if you need me for this meeting I'm on annual leave on Thursday, I'm back on Friday.
Cheers,
Amy


Hello,
Can we reschedule this? I would prefer to have it when Amy is in the office (he had to leave for two weeks).
Thanks a lot.
Amy


Hi Mike,
No problem at all, but do you mind if we push it back a little? I've got a meeting 1-2pm but I'll be back in the office by 2.30pm if that works for you.
Cheers,
Jon


Hi Mike,
We are still meeting with BMW for another 2 hours from 15:00.
Apologies for any inconvenience but we might not get the time to meet now.
I'll get back in touch next week.
John


Apologies can we make it at 4:00 today? I'm giving training from 2:00 - 3.0


Hi Mike,
I'm really sorry for any inconvenience but I can't make 2pm today and also Amy is out of the office.
Could we reschedule to 15.0 or 16:00 tomorrow?
John


Hi Mike, very sorry, had to take my kid to the doctor, since she got worst from a flu.
Can you please reschedule for:
Tuesday 3pm GMT?
Wednesday morning until 2pm GMT?
Once again, really sorry.
Luis


Hi Mike,
Could we move to this date - all well, just a new year start with a bang!
Happy new year to you BTW!
Kind regards,


Hi Mike,
I've been unable to chat with the other relevant party heads on this yet since the CEO is out of the office. Can we delay this until next week? Sorry for the late notice.
Regards,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Apologies for the last minute notice but I had to leave the office due to unforeseen circumstances so won't be able to attend. Can we reschedule for tomorrow or next week?
Regards
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
I'm afraid I won't be able to do this call.
I can do the same time on Friday if that works for you?
Cheers,
Alex


Morning Mike,
I was wondering if we could postpone our discussion today to tomorrow morning please as I will be with a client now for most of today.
Kind regards,
Ad.
Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,

old: Di, 13.06.17
new: Do, 08.06.17.
Kind regards!
Ben


Sorry Mike, I was out all of last week so a bit manic trying to catch up and then I'm away at Best Connect next week. If you going to be in Amsterdam then let's meet in person otherwise please get in touch week of the 22nd to reschedule?
Regards,
Ben


Hi Mike,
Please could we re-arrange the call as I will be traveling this morning and might be in poor reception. I can do Friday or early next week if that suits you.
Thanks
Ben


Hello Mike,
I am sorry to delay again,
I will be in a last minute road trip, for a week,
Best regards,


Dear Mike,
How about 14:00 Berlin time or later?
Best regards,
Philip Heiner


Mike,
I am very sorry to miss our call. I got stuck on a call with our chairman that ran over.
Amy, please reschedule.
Leo


Hi Mike,
Sorry again for the delays. I've had to call in sick today after catching a horrible cold and considering how I'm still feeling right now, I may well not be in tomorrow either.
Therefore could we re-schedule for later in the week? Thurs or Fri? That should give you some more time to review the steps as well?
Thanks,
John


Hello,
I have to manage new resources this week so I propose to re-schedule the meeting.
Regards.


Hi,
I was hoping if possible to move the meeting on Monday 6th February to 5pm?
Or possibly 3-4pm.
Would either of these times work?
Many thanks,
Regards,
Ben


Sorry I won't be able to make this tomorrow can we move it please to another date


Hi Mike. Running late, in business lunch. Can we schedule for Tuesday? Sorry.


Hi Mike!
Can we push back to 2.0? Sorry I'm caught in another meeting.
Best,
Philip Heiner


Yeah sorry,
I am very busy for this end of year,
let's talk Thursday 7th of January instead.
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike!
Sorry about all of this - I've unfortunately had something come up. Any chance we can chat this time next week?
Thanks!
Sam


Hello Mike,
i would like to apologize about not attended to our Skype call.
I am currently back to work after new year.
The workload this period is high so i would like to give me the opportunity to come in contact with you myself again the circumstances are suitable.
Thank you and a happy new year!
Ben
