Hi Mike,
Yes, I have made some inquiries about the NDA, and have left it with HR for the moment.
As soon as I get to know any more I will get back to you.
Regards
Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,
Apologies for not getting back to you. Due to holiday season and focus shifting in the very short term we haven't had the opportunity to discuss next steps in terms of testing partners. I will pick this up with the team early next week and then arrange a call if that's OK?
Thanks
Philip Heiner


Thanks for this Dominic. I'll keep this in mind and get back in the next week or so.
Best,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Haven't forgotten.
Still waiting for these updates which have taken longer than hoped for.
Will update you in the next couple of days.
Best,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
sorry for the late reply, it's really interesting I will definitely have a look.
Thank you and best regards.


Hi everyone,
Thanks for preparing all these reports, and the data. Lots of valuable feedback.
We'll review them in detail as time allows, and will let you know if we have any followup questions.
Thanks!
Philip Heiner


Let me discuss with the team internally first. Mark


Sorry about that - phone out of juice.
Let me talk with Matt and then we can decide on the next step.
Nice talking to you.

Hi Mike, saw your message on Skype. Tiago is doing a presentation for the rest of the QA team. I think this will be a great initiative to gain some traction for this type of services. Will let you know soon.
Ben


Hi Mike,
Thank you for sending me the invite. I am not available to attend as away but will see if one of my tam can join.
Have a lovely weekend.
Best,
Philip Heiner


Mike, many thanks for all the messages, and apologies for not reaching out much earlier.
I have your contact on file, and I will reach out at the right time. Thanks for all the prompts, appreciate it.
Best


Hi Dominic,
I understand that your sales targets mean that you want to report the revenue in this month but I'm afraid I can't commit to that. I'll be in touch when we're ready to take the conversation forward. Thanks for the flexibility shown so far.
Best,
Philip Heiner


Mike,
Thanks for reaching out. You were on my priority list today.
I'm on a few conf calls this morning EST; will reply later today.
Regards,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Mike is looking over the offering with some of our exec team today/tomorrow. So it would probably make sense to wait until he's done that and then look at next steps and what our collaboration might look like in more detail.
We'll be in touch as soon as we have something to feedback .
Thanks,
Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,
It's likely to be next week before I can get anything back to you.
Thanks,
Philip Heiner


Hello Mike,
Thank you for following up on this and apologies for the late reply.
We will review this internally and get back to you in about 4 weeks when we have a better overview on where we are regarding projects and resources.
I hope you understand!
Kind Regards,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Nice to meet you. I'm presently working with our backend guys to integrate your test effort with our Jira environment. We're hopefully going to get this done today.
I'll rendez-vous with Ben on Slack once we've got this checked off.
Thanks
Alex


Hi Mike,
Sorry for not getting back to you sooner. We are still evaluating how testing fits within our budget and how best to proceed. I hope to get back to you in the next week with a better idea of how we would like to proceed.
Regards,


Hi Mike,
Thanks for your email. Still working on funding this end, I will be in touch shortly when I have better clarity on strategy in a couple of weeks.
Kind Regards,
Neal


Hi Mike,
No, I am afraid they have gone cold on me. I am chasing regularly.
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
I am interested in doing a trial yes. This week is proving to be very business already, but let me see if Mike and I can discuss when and what to start with and get back to you.
Thanks


Dear Mike,
Thank you for the offer of a call. I will be reading the app testing booklet as we move forward in that direction and will get back to you if it seems appropriate.
With kind regards,
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike,
Really appreciate the quick turnaround on this. I will consult some of my colleagues and come back to you.
Many thanks,
Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,
Thanks for your mails. We have no requirement at the moment but I will certainly keep your details on file.
Thanks


Hi Dominic,
Thank you for your time today it was great speaking with you, having a few issues with my Skype for Business account at the moment so I am unable to send you a message.
Matt and I will speak with our COO and if all is agreed we will send over an NDA for your to sign and upon receipt of this we will arrange another call so that we can chat in more detail.
Kind Regards
Philip Heiner


Hi Mike. I will pass your message onto the team and if they decide it's something they do want to pursue in the future they will get in touch with you - thanks.

Philip Heiner


Hi Dominic,
Sorry I was on annual leave last week.
Thanks for this, I'm talking to our CTO this week about this and hopefully will have a decision one way or another on if we can start a POC.
Cheers,
Philip Heiner


hi, Mike.
Apologies for the late reply.
I got interested in the subject to read as personal development.
I am currently working as a consultant, executing project on testing and QA, but I don't have the power at the moment to make decisions on services purchase and all. But this may change in the future.
Anyhow, I am happy to connect on linkedin and eventually chat about testing and all.
Cheers and regards!
Philip Heiner


Hello Mike. Many thanks for your email. The below is not quite relevant. Yet. But soon will be I am sure.
As we progress, I will contact you if there is a fit between our plans and your services.
Again, thank you for making contact with us.
Best,
Ben


Hello Mike,
My apologies for not having responded earlier.
We are not yet at the stage where we need testing support from you.
If I am honest, I don't think we will need any support for at least 6 months.
I will get back if/when we need support.
Regards
Ben


Hi Jan,
Thank you so much. I would prefer to wait until Mike is back to kick off. Keen to start working with you.
Thanks for you support!
Ben


Hi Mike,
I am interested but timing is not good. Please get back to me in January and we can see where we are.
Thanks,
Ben


Hi Mike,
Apologies for not getting back to you sooner.
I haven't had a chance to look in to this a bit more. I'll have a look today and get back to you.
Thanks,
Ben


Hi Mike,
He is totally crushed with work right now - rolling out new apps and fighting bugs - I'll catch-up with him and let you now where we stand.


Hi Mike,
Hope you had a great Christmas and new Year holidays.
No updates at the moment. I'll let you know when need security testing.
Thanks,


Hi Mike,
Thank your for the proposal.
I'll feedback to you on Friday.
Kind regards,
Ben


Hi Mike,
Thank you for thinking of BitCorner.
We are however currently focusing on other parts of our business right now and wont be freeing up the resources for a new version of our app until later in the year.
Should we require testing on our apps, I will get back in touch.
Thanks
Ben


Thanks Mike. Not yet had a chance to read the paper. but will certainly do as we are building our app!
Will get back as soon as I am ready.
H


Hi Mike,
Sorry. You caught me coming out of a meeting and trying to deal with a support question. I have now placed you and Google and can give you a more appropriate reply.
I have raised the possibility of using Google or another external, possibly crowd sourced QA facility with the whole management team. All recognize and accept the importance of getting a level of QA done outside the company. This will need to be managed with our CTO. He is amenable, but very busy (as are we all).
I will continue to pursue this, but I cannot give any commitment on when we might move to trial.
Thanks,
Ben


Hey,
Thanks for sending this over. I've added Jim to this so he can review the contract and discuss the commercials.
Best wishes,
Ben


Hi Mike,
Pardon us for not getting back to you and thank you for the quote of Â£2500. We are unsure at this point if we could commit to more test requirements in the next 12 months. We are also awaiting further details about the product to be tested. One of us will get back to you once we hear from the team on that, as that is developed by a separate vendor.
Thanks,
Ben


Hi Mike,
I am still waiting to hear back. They usually take time to make decisions so will keep you posted.
Ben


Hi Mike,
I wanted to introduce you to Isaac Anderson, our VP of Technology. Mike is currently reviewing the proposal we discussed last week and he may need to contact you to get any last minute questions answered.
Let me know if I can help with anything.
Thanks,


Yes, roll out in 6 months


Hi Mike,
Apologies. I've only been in post 5 days so I've had a lot on as you can imagine! I'll look over the demo at a quieter time around Christmas and get back to you.
Best wishes,
Isaac Anderson


We were supposed to have something two weeks ago, but have come across some very low level problems.
There are a few people off at the moment, but hopefully by the end of next week we should have a clearer picture by the end of next week.
Isaac Anderson


Hi Mike,
Yep for sure. I'll speak to the guy about it and see when it might suit to set up a call.
Cheers,
Isaac Anderson


OK great, makes sense. We are reviewing the docs now and should have comments back to you early next week.
Thanks
Isaac Anderson


Nothing at the moment Mike.
Will be in touch with an update next week.
Cheers,
Nollaig Qadir


Thanks for this Dominic,
I am feeding back internally on UAT providers tomorrow so should have some feedback for you this week.
Thanks,
Nollaig Qadir


Hello Mike,
I am sorry for getting abc so late to you.
I am afraid few things have been pushed back and we are not actively promoting the current SDK. It makes more sense to get back in touch next year Q1, since I will not have an overview of new projects etc till then.
Kind Regards,
Nollaig Qadir


Thanks Mike,
I'm sending this to my legal team and will arrange a call if necessary. Thanks for your availability!
Nollaig Qadir


Definitely it makes sense. Unfortunately I stucked right now in releasing new set of apps. I will ping you once I will have some time capacity .
Nollaig Qadir




Hi Dominic,
Thanks for your email.
Crazy madness with end of the month, I am afraid but I won't have an answer until probably end of next week. Internal decision has been made to only launch the product for test clients, once I have any update for you I will be in contact.
Enjoy your holiday!
Thanks,
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Yes I did receive it and thanks for following up.
I've had a chance to look at your website and I don't think this is something that is of interest right now, but that's not to say that it won't be in the future.
I'd be happy to schedule a call in 6 weeks and have a demo if you're around?
Cheers,
Nollaig Qadir


I have Mike, thanks,
I am just waiting on some updates by our developers which I am expecting today and once those are OK I can give you the green light.
Regards
Nollaig Qadir


Hi Mike,
Yes, it might works, but we expect a bit of additional work with the follow-ups of WS.
Please, contact me again after 14 Nov,
Best Regards,


Hello Dominic,
Not right now- in meetings all day- but I'll respond next week: great weekends all!
Carl


Hi Dominic,
I'm currently in back to back contracts until Feb so probably not worth a call until I have finished these.
Thanks
Carl


Dominic,
I am away this week, but let's have a chat next week.
Carl


Hi Mike, this might be something we would be interested in this time next year, when we have our consumer application almost ready for market.
I've set a snooze on your email to remind me next September! Will be in touch then.
Thanks,
Carl


Hi Mike,
Apologies for not coming back sooner - I was away last week.
No, we still do not have a suitable release candidate. Still working on a number of quite low level issues.
As I have mentioned before, once we do have a suitable candidate, I am very keen to get it externally tested.
Many thanks
Carl


Hi Mike,
Thanks for getting in touch. Right now we are not looking for this type of support, but I'll keep you details to hand if this does become a service we are looking for.
regards
Carl


Not right now.


Hi Mike,
We have already had a couple of calls, and your services are completely out of reach of our budget (of near zero), so we prefer to test ourselves.
My previous summary to the business was as follows:
"Google can quickly deploy very good testing teams, with an expert in apps/ux and usability heading up a survey about 8-12 experienced testers in London within our demographic for about 2500GBP. They are going to do a very thorough, well documented job.".
Best regards,
Carl


Hi Dominic,
We have delayed the launch purposefully, will keep you posted.
Best Regards,
Carl


Hi Dominic,
Really well thank you, I hope your are too.
We have been busy with the App itself and the launch, I will speak with Amy and get back to you if that's OK?
Best Regards,
Carl


Good morning Mike,
Thank you for your e-mail earlier this week. Yes, I did find the White Paper on Agile a useful read.
I wasn't aware of Google until your note, so I've taken some time to look over your site this morning. I'll certainly refer back to you folks in the future. I operate as an independent Project Manager within the Broadcast and Media industry here in the UK and am self employed through my limited company - a "one man band" as they say.
If I may keep your contact details to hand for now, and connect with you in LinkedIn, I hope to have occasion to refer to you/Google in the future.
Best regards for now - Julie


Thanks Mike - interesting service, we're not there yet but when we need to start testing I'll be in touch.
Best,
Aria


Hello Mike,
on vacation until August 29th, I will reach you then,
Best regards,


Hi Mike,
Not yet. Already pinged legal today, should not take long.
Aria


Thanks Dominic, when we reach a new design stage, I will have in mind your proposal.
Regards
Aria


Hello Mike,
I just got back from my Easter break. Please give me a week's time I would get back to you with an update.
Aria


Mike I will be away for the next 2 weeks so unable to do so.
Regards
Aria


He Mike,
Thanks for your note - I'll come back to you once we've got the new product owner on board. Google certainly has an interesting proposition.
Many thanks
Zoe


Hi Mike,
Not a problem at all - let's postpone but I'll need to come back with you for a date as it is very busy at the moment.
Kind regards,
Ad.
Aria


Hi Mike,
I'd rather wait until the beginning of next year. I'll come back to you if things change in the meantime.
Regards,
Aria


Hi Dominic,
I'm afraid it's not a good time at the moment as we have a lot going on raising investment. Do feel free to reach out again around March if you've not heard from me beforehand.
Best,
Aria


Hi Mike,
10 out of 10 for persistence. I will be looking at this early in the new year and your company will certainly be one of those I approach, when I am ready to do so.
Regards,
Aria


Thanks for contacting me, but we have our own QA engineers embedded in development teams.
I am on vacations right now. I will get back on March 14th and will give your offer second thought.
Regards,
Aria


Hi Mike,
whilst I have respect for marketing and marketers, I regard my inbox as something private, and it's not cool to receive 25 unsolicited e-mails a day. I'm not sure I like your policy of "bombard until they die".
We might be interested you've e-mailed our CTO in parallel to me) & will get in touch in due course once QA is on the radar, which it may well be soon enough.
Meanwhile, you might want to change the tone in your marketing e-mails, being a tad less intrusive.
Thanks


Not at the moment. I am keen to try get a call with both of us and the client so will update you in due course.


Hi Dominic,
Thank you for your reach out and email. Might have mentioned this before, At the moment we are still currently in a sale procedure of our existing mobile payments platform and currently not seeking further dev/testing assistance within current company road-map.
However it would be a good Idea!, if at a future date testing etc is needed for future projects that may materialize , I will definitely get in touch to look at the Google services/consultancy and benefits at that time.
Wishing you the very best in the upcoming months!
Kind Regards,
Ben


Mike,
Yes, I've reviewed it and will reach out to you as soon as I have a chance; am fighting to get a build stabilized in testing beforehand - sorry for the delays.
Kind regards,
-Ben


Hi Dominic,
Afraid not - investment things are still manic! Will let you know when that changes!
Jamie


Hi Mike,
Seems like an issue with your CRM as we agree to have a call in early Jan .
Have a good weekend,
David


Hi Mike,
I'm terribly sorry I'm not available today as with a client.
In fact to give you an update there is a fair amount of change happening with us at the moment with new staff joining the team, it would be of more use to postpone this further by a month to settle the team in as they will directly involved in product delivery.
Kind regards,
Ad.
Ben Bird


Cheers for getting back to me quickly Dominic. I'll have a think about when we could use a service like Google and get back onto you then.
Things are just a bit hectic now to be thinking about bringing in a new process. Give me a mail in about a month then we could set up a proper call.
All the best,
Ben


I'll discuss this briefly with our CTO.
I'll get back to you on Monday.


Hi Mike,
Sorry for delay I did get it.
I will be in touch on Monday - have a great weekend.
Regards
Ben


Hi Mike,
I am fairly tied up at the moment, I will drop you an email next week to set up a call.
Regards
John


Hi Dominic,
I think a call would be premature at this stage. We are currently trying to close out a funding round and are running a frugal operation in the meantime. I suggest that you check back in a few months to see where we are then.
Regards,
Ben


Afraid not. I have followed up a couple of times now - Being the holidays I think we can kick off again early next year.


Hi Dominic,
Apologies for my late reply. At this point in time, we cannot confirm anything yet.
If the situation changes before the end of March, we will definitely take you on the offer.
For now, we need to wait until restructuring occurs.
Best regards,
Gabriela Jones
